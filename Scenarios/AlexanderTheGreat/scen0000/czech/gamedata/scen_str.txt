# Remarks
#
# - This file contains all the message strings for the Alexander the Great 
#   scenario. It contains nothing else.
# - The order of the strings has been synchronized in the English, German
#   and Italian version. This has not been done for the French, Spanish and 
#   Japanese version, since those files are missing from the CTP2 source 
#   code project.
# - If you add new strings make sure that you add them at the same location
#   in every language version you have.
# - For easy comparison between the languages make sure that the number
#   of lines in each language file version is the same and that also the
#   comments are at the same place.
# - Keep also the indentation the same.
# - You may add comments after the last line of strings that are specific to 
#   one language only.
#

#
# Modifications from the original Activision code:
#
# - Synchronized the string sequenze between the English, German and Italian
#   of that file.
# - Removed Christain propaganda about Babylon.
# - German version only: Replaced formal addressing by Sie by King's and 
#   Queen's formal addressing of Ihr.

# Start game strings
AG_START_TITLE		"Alexander the Great"
AG_START_A		"It is May, 334 B.C. You are Alexander, King of Macedonia. You stand on the shores of Asia, ready to plunge into the Persian Empire. Your father Philip forged Macedonia into a powerful nation, but died before he could invade Persia. His death left you king at only 21 years of age. He also left you with a veteran army ready for anything."
AG_START_B		"You have spent two years consolidating your power, and now its time to continue where your father Philip left off. Persia is a shadow of its former glory, but still you will be like a fly attacking an elephant. The odds are against you, but the world has never seen anyone with your talent and potential."
AG_START_C		"Your armies await you to the South and Southeast, ready to invade Persia at your command. Before you launch your invasion, it is recommended you read the reports in the Great Library on Macedonia, Persia, and your other neighboring countries. Also be sure to familiarize yourself with the special rules of this scenario."

# Miscellaneous strings
AG_CORINTH_SETTLER	"The Corinthian League proves their friendship by giving you a Settler to help colonize your new conquests. In truth, Greece is very overpopulated, and the Corinthian League doesn't mind getting rid of some excess population. In the future look for additional Settler gifts, but only while the Corinthians remain your ally."
AG_CORINTH_SETTLER2	"The Corinthian League proves their friendship by giving you a Settler to help colonize your new conquests."
AG_DISBAND_FAIL		"You can't disband {unit[0].name}!"
AG_GORDIUM_A		"In the city of Gordium there is a famous chariot of an ancient king. Legend has it that the first person to untie the knot of the yoke of the chariot would become king of all of Asia. With most of your army watching, you try to untie the knot, but fail. So you draw your sword and cut the knot in half! Was that the proper solution?"
AG_GORDIUM_B		"That night, thunder and lightning across the sky shows that the God Zeus approves. Word quickly spreads that you are destined to conquer Persia, and that the Gods smile upon you. Your reputation improves amongst the Greeks and Corinthian League."
AG_THEOCRACY		"Great men in the ancient world are worshipped as gods, and there has been speculation if you too are a god. To further control your Empire, you proclaim that, yes, you are semi-divine, secretly born of the god Ammon! You now have the option for a Theocratic government where all your subjects will be encouraged to worship you."
AG_REGARD_EVENT_NEG	"An Ancient Hatred exists between your people."
AG_REGARD_EVENT		"People disapprove of your actions."
AG_REGARD_EVENT_POS	"Your actions have impressed many people."

# General strings
AG_PARMENION_PLOT	"A plot to kill you has been uncovered! The assassin was slain. However, it was found that General Parmenion's son Philotas knew of the assassin's plans and told no one. This could be a larger plot ultimately leading back to General Parmenion, your best general and close friend. Do you:"
AG_PARMENION_DEFECT	"You rush a message to Parmenion, explaining that you still trust him, no matter what. But he cannot believe such trust and assumes you're merely waiting for a better chance to get rid of him. Afraid of death, he flees without talking to you. Undoubtedly, he will sell his services to one of your enemies."
AG_PARMENION_TRAIT	"A secret messenger is sent to the other commanders under Parmenion. The must choose between their immediate leader and Alexander. They unhesitatingly choose you, and kill Parmenion before he's aware what has happened. Though he may not have been guilty, he could no longer be trusted and so he had to go."
AG_PARMENION_LOYAL	"A messenger is rushed to Parmenion, letting him know what happened. In the message you point out you could have had Parmenion killed before he ever got the news, but that you would never consider such a thing for such a close, loyal friend. Impressed and reassurred, Parmenion swallows any thoughts of treason."
AG_PARMENION_OLD	"Already well into his sixties, if not even older, General Parmenion finally dies of old age. It was remarkable he lived as long as he did, since he fought with King Philip many decades before you were born, and led armies ever since. Many said that Parmenion was the best Macedonian general ever, besides yourself."
AG_PARMENION_BATTLE	"General Parmenion goes down fighting in battle! Well over sixty years old, Parmenion was a remarkably spry man for his age, but not quick enough to deflect the sword that slew him. Many said that Parmenion was the best Macedonian general ever, besides yourself of course."
AG_ANTIPATER_OLD	"General Antipater is no more! Almost sixty when you became king, the Gods decided his time had come. He died in his sleep after a lifetime of fighting for Macedonia. A man of such experience and skill will be hard to replace."
AG_ANTIPATER_BATTLE	"General Antipater dies in battle! Almost sixty when you became king, the Gods decided his time had come. A man of such experience and skill will be hard to replace."
AG_CRATERUS_OLD		"General Craterus is dead! Craterus was a very intense man: intensely loyal, intensely emotional, but unfortunately he was also an intense drinker. He was found dead in the morning, after a long night of revelry. Such a good general and close friend will be sorely missed."
AG_CRATERUS_BATTLE	"General Craterus suffers a mortal blow in battle! Craterus was a passionate, and headstrong man. Though you often argued with him, he was one of your closest companions and most loyal generals. Such a good general and close friend will be sorely missed."
AG_HEPHAESTION		"Though you have lost a great general, fear not. Your close partner Hephaestion is ready as an equally capable replacement. Be careful however: there are only so many men who have the skill to masterfully lead your men."
AG_PTOLEMY		"Although another general has died, there is a man ready to resume his duties immediately. Your childhood friend Ptolemy, while still very young like you, is up to the task. Be careful however: men of his caliber are hard to find."
AG_SELEUCUS		"You have lost another general. Once again, there is an able replacement. Seleucus, a childhood friend, is ready to become a leading general. Unfortunately, you have used up your reserve of capable leaders. In the future there will be no more general replacements."
AG_HEPHAESTION_OLD	"General Hephaestion has died! Like so many soldiers on your campaigns into strange lands, he was swiftly taken by disease. He was your close friend, and you are inconsolable with grief. You vow to one day make the greatest mausoleum in history to honor his memory."
AG_HEPHAESTION_BATTLE	"General Hepheastion is killed in battle! Hephaestion was more than a friend, he was your mentor. You would have gladly died in his place. You vow to one day make the greatest mausoleum in history to honor his memory. But today your goal is to seek revenge upon those who killed him!"
AG_PTOLEMY_OLD		"A sudden plague has killed General Ptolemy! Ptolemy was a close childhood friend, and most likely your half-brother. He was quite possibly the cleverest of your comrades. It will be impossible to replace a talented, loyal friend like him."
AG_PTOLEMY_BATTLE	"General Ptolemy has died fighting! He was the cleverest of your comrades, but this time his cleverness got the best of him, as a bold move by his soldiers was discovered and countered. He will be hard to replace."
AG_SELEUCUS_OLD		"General Seleucus is dead! After a wild night of drinking and carousing, he developed pneumonia and died a few days later. So many of your best soldiers and friends have died, leaving you increasingly alone."
AG_SELEUCUS_BATTLE	"General Seleucus is dead! Your childhood friend was brave in battle, but today the luck of the Gods was not with him. So many of your best soldiers and friends have died, leaving you increasingly alone."
AG_GENERAL_DROWN	"{drownedGeneral.name} has been lost at sea! For days after, you have terrible nightmares about drowning, where the sea is a malevolent entity clutching you in his icy embrace, forcing water down your throat until your lungs explode. You hope to avoid sea travel for now."

# Endgame-related strings
AG_ALEX_DEFEAT_A	"You fall on the battlefield, your army crumbling around you. A quick-thinking messenger scoops your unconscious body onto his mount and flees to your nearest city. For days you hover on the brink of death, but eventually recover enough to show yourself to your comrades. Many fall to the ground and weep with joy."
AG_ALEX_DEFEAT_B	"While you've miraculously cheated death, your body will never be the same. Instead of charging into battle at the head of your troops, it will be a painful effort to make it to the battlefield at all. Take good care: all hopes for the empire are riding on your continued survival!"
AG_ALEX_DEAD		"Your luck has run out; you've been killed in battle! Charging recklessly into the heart of the battle as you always do, you fight courageously, but an unseen sword thrust cuts right through you. Other Macedonians may be able to carry forward your dreams of world conquest, but for you the game is over."
AG_ALEX_SHIP_A		"Trapped on a ship, you are unable to use your fighting skills to save yourself! As the ship goes down, you helplessly fall into the water. But it isn't that easy to kill the great Alexander: you manage to stay afloat long enough to be picked up by another ship, and are quickly whisked to {city[0].name}"
AG_ALEX_SHIP_B		"All is not well however. Falling wooden beams broke many bones in your body as your ship snapped into pieces. Thank the Gods that you are still alive, but your body will never be the same. Take good care! From now on, the smallest battle wound might finish you off, and your weak body is vulnerable to disease."
AG_ALEX_DROWN		"How unwise to travel by ship, where your fighting skills are useless. Your ship sinks, and all hands on board go down to the murky depths, including you. What an ordinary death for such an extraordinary man. Other Macedonians may continue your dream of world conquest, but for you, the game is over."
AG_ALEX_STAGE1		"You start to show the first signs of physical weakening."
AG_ALEX_STAGE2		"You have lost a little more of the vitality of your youth."
AG_ALEX_STAGE3		"You are getting pretty weak."
AG_ALEX_STAGE4		"Your health is shattered. Your feeble body is now very susceptible to disease. You can decrease your chances of a disease killing you by surrounding yourself with the best doctors money can buy. This will cost 1000 Gold per turn though. Will you call for the doctors?"
AG_ALEX_DISEASE		"In your weakened state, you catch Pneumonia and die. The last thing you think before darkness claims you is that you wish you had died with a sword in your hand."
AG_ALEX_DISEASE2	"Despite your precautions and hiring the best doctors to tend to you, Pneumonia takes your life. The last thing you think before darkness claims you is that you wish you had died with a sword in your hand."

# Persian strings
AG_SCOUT_REPORT_A	"The peninsula of Asia Minor (Turkey) contains Persia's most important cities. These are the ethnically Greek cities on the west coast, where Persia gets most of its Hoplite soldiers. However, most of these cities are rebellious, and would eagerly await your liberating armies."
AG_SCOUT_REPORT_B	"The other major source of Persian power is in Phoenicia (Tyre, Sidon and Aradus). The Phoenicians man the large Persian navy. Scouts spotted a large Persian army near Dascylium, led by General Memnon. Luckily, most of the Persian navy is supressing revolt in Egypt."
AG_SCOUT_REPORT_C	"Your first major task should be to control the southern and western coast of Asia Minor before the Persian navy returns to attack you."
AG_TYRE_APPROACH	"Control of Tyre is the key to controlling this entire region. But the people of Tyre aren't worried; their city is build on a hill and has very tough defenses. No one has ever successfully stormed this city. If you can, it would be a big boost to your reputation."
AG_TYRE_BESIDE		"Scouts report that Tyre is heavily defended! A direct assault now will likely result in many deaths on your side. A prolonged bombardment with many Catapults is highly advised to soften up the defenses."
AG_TYRE_CONQUER		"You have done the impossible and conquered Tyre! None thought that such a strongly defended city could be conquered by anyone. Your reputation is greatly boosted amongst nearby nations. The cities of the Corinithian League are especially less likely to cross you. They see that if you can conquer Tyre, you can conquer them."

# Phoenican Strings
AG_PHOEN_ENTER		"You are at an important junction. To the northwest is Asia Minor, to the east is Mesopotamia, center of the Persian Empire, and to the south are the coastal cities of Phoenicia. Control the Phoenician cities and Persia will not have much ability to build ships. It is likely they will freely join you, but only after Darius is dead."
AG_PHOEN_ENTER2		"You are at an important junction. To the northwest is Asia Minor, to the east is Mesopotamia, center of the Persian Empire, and to the south are the coastal cities of Phoenicia. Now that Darius is defeated, the Phoenicians are ready to join you, and only wait for you in person. Without Phoenicia, Persia will not have much of a navy."
AG_PHOEN_ARADUS		"The citizens of Aradus would gladly surrender to you, but while they hate Darius, they still fear him. Come back for a friendly reception once Darius has been defeated."
AG_PHOEN_ARADUS2	"The citizens of Aradus throw open their gates and warmly greet you, their new hero! About a dozen years ago, Aradus and Sidon rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed by the Persians. They welcome anyone who helps them throw off the Persian yoke."
AG_PHOEN_SIDON		"The citizens of Sidon would gladly surrender to you, but while they hate Darius, they still fear him. Come back for a friendly reception once Darius has been defeated."
AG_PHOEN_SIDON2		"Sidon turns itself over to the Macedonians! Before its recent rebellion, Sidon was the largest and most important city in this region. Now, Persia has let Tyre take over Sidon's position. So while Sidon gladly welcomes you, its rival Tyre will fight you to the last."

# Egypt strings
AG_GAZA_BESIDE		"Although many cities in this region are eager to surrender to you, Gaza isn't one of them. This city has built up a large fortune as the end point of a caravan route to and from Southern Arabia, and they don't want to give up their treasures. They also believe their walls are impregnable."
AG_GAZA_CONQUER		"The city of Gaza is yours! You have truly shown yourself to be skilled at conquering well defended cities. In the governor's house you find an additional treasure of 1500 gold."
AG_EGYPT_CNT_DEFECT	"Scouts report that the Egyptians are ready to give themselves over to the Macedonians, but only if Alexander appears in person."
AG_EGYPT_DEFECT		"The natives of Egypt joyously celebrate the arrival of the great Alexander! The Egyptians have repeatedly rebelled against the Persians, only to be reconquered each time. Egyptians see you as their salvation from this cycle of misery, and throw off the Persian yoke from all of Egypt! Persian soldiers flee, leaving you with a ruined land."
AG_EGYPT_TYRE		"Scouts report that the Egyptians are ready to give themselves over to the Macedonians, but they are afraid of retribution from the Persian navy. Conquer Tyre, and the Egyptians will accept you gladly."

# Barsine and first Darius defeat
AG_DARIUS_DEFEAT_OTHER	"Scouts report that Darius' army was defeated by the {player[0].civ_name_plural}. Darius himself, seeing how the battle was shaping up, cowardly fled well before the battle was over. At least his craven maneuver has left you the opportunity to personally rid the world of Darius."
AG_DARIUS_DEFEAT_A	"Darius' army has been defeated in battle! Darius himself, seeing how the battle was shaping up, cowardly fled well before the battle was over. So while his personal guard was killed, Darius escaped with little more than his horse surviving with him. Your army overruns Darius' camp."
AG_DARIUS_DEFEAT_B	"Darius travels with all the splendor expected of the King of Kings. Not only have you found jewels and treasures worth 30,000 gold, but many important people have been left behind. Among the nobles and relatives stranded by Darius' flight is Barsine, Memnon's wife. She was a childhood friend of yours."
AG_BARSINE_A		"You find yourself strongly attracted to Barsine. She's young, beautiful, smart, and friends with powerful people in both Persia and Greece. Having been married to Memnon, a Greek fighting for Persia, she is comfortable in both Persian and Greek languages and societies."
AG_BARSINE_B		"Should you make this woman your wife? Her deceased husband was your enemy. Further, she is a prisoner of war! Can she be trusted? Your reputation will surely suffer, as people will think you marry her to rub it in your enemies' faces. Do you take her as your wife now or keep her as your mistress for the time being?"
AG_BARSINE2_B		"You find yourself interested in marrying such an exceptional woman. However, she is married to Memnon, your traitorous enemy! You decide take her as a mistress now, and bide your time until Memnon is killed or defeated. Only if you are properly married can she produce an heir acceptable to all."
AG_BARSINE_MARRY	"In a shotgun wedding only days after her capture, you marry Barsine. Both Persians and Greeks are scandalized by your arrogant behavior. This will certainly hurt diplomatic relations back in Greece. At least you have a honeymoon to get your mind off such troubles."
AG_BARSINE_MARRY2	"Only weeks after Memnon's funeral, you marry his widow Barsine. Both Persians and Greeks are scandalized by your arrogant behavior. This will certainly hurt diplomatic relations back in Greece. At least you have a honeymoon to get your mind of such troubles."
AG_BARSINE_POISON	"Someone tried to assassinate you by poisoning your drink! Luckily you didn't drink enough to get a fatal dose. You discover the deed was ordered by the brother of your wife Barsine, who is a commander in the Persian army. He considers no method too low to get rid of the man who married his sister by force."
AG_BARSINE_2YEARS	"It has been two years since you captured Memnon's widow Barsine. She is happy being your mistress, and no one would think the worst of you if you marry her now. Do you wish to marry her?"
AG_BARSINE_2YEARS2	"It has been two years since Memnon died, leaving Barsine a widow. She is happy being your mistress, and no one would think the worst of you if you marry her now. Do you wish to marry her?"
AG_BARSINE_MARRY3	"Congratulations on your marriage with Barsine. You take a break from your official duties to have a pleasant marriage ceremony and honeymoon."
AG_BARSINE_WIDOW_A	"Now that Memnon is dead, you face the decision on what to do with his wife, Barsine. She has been your mistress since you captured her in Darius' war camp. The two of you have enjoyed each other's company on the rare occasions you've had time to see her."
AG_BARSINE_WIDOW_B	"Is it time for you to marry Barsine? Many will say that you've allowed Memnon to die only so you could steal his wife away. And can you trust her, or is she acting friendly only to get revenge in Memnon's name, later? Will you marry Barsine?"

# Statiera and second Darius defeat
AG_DARIUS_DEAD_OTHER	"Scouts report that Darius has been killed in battle by the {player[0].civ_name_plural}. You are bitter that you did not get to defeat him personally, but the world is better off with him dead."
AG_DARIUS_DEAD_A	"Your army has killed Darius! Knowing his tendency to flee, you order troops to perform a daring encirclement maneuver to prevent him from getting away a second time. In this you are successful. But trapped from fleeing, Darius gets caught up in hand to hand fighting and is killed by a stray spear."
AG_DARIUS_DEAD_B	"Once again, the booty left behind in Darius' camp is incredible: 20,000 gold! In addition, you have captured Darius' entire family unharmed, including Darius' mother, wife and many children. The capture of the Persian royal family presents you with important choices..."
AG_DARIUS_DEAD_C	"Since the Persians have a long tradition of respecting royal hostages, you can treat them generously, which will cost you 250 Gold per turn. Or alternately, you may kill them. Cruel, yes, but not unprecedented. Alive, the children may one day rebel and cause trouble. What will you do?"
AG_PERSIAN_KILL		"It was a painful choice, but many other leaders have done the same. You kill the entire Persian royal family, saying it is revenge for all the atrocities Persia has committed against Greece over the years. Reaction in Greece is mostly positive, since many are happy to see the Persians suffer."
AG_PERSIAN_PAMPER	"The Persian royal family is very grateful to you for your kindness, and appear to be very content in their new role as pampered prisoners."
AG_STAT_A		"When you captured Darius' family, you may also have found yourself a wife. Darius' eldest daughter Stateira is coming of age, and is increasingly beautiful. The political benefit of such a marriage is obvious: marrying into the Persian royal family may greatly increase your acceptance amongst the Persians."
AG_STAT_B		"On the other hand, she is a prisoner of war and does not like you. Plus, your reputation amongst Greeks will plummet. Many complain that your conquest of foreign lands is turning you into more of a foreigner than a Greek--this will confirm their fears."
AG_STAT_C		"Additionally, the wedding ceremony will cost 5000 gold. To marry into the Persian royal family you must follow the proper ritual and spectacle. What will you do?"
AG_STAT_MARRY_A		"You waste no time preparing for your wedding with Stateira. In a huge wedding ceremony, not only do the Macedonian and Persian royal lines merge, but you also marry most of your top officers to Persian nobility and royalty. A merging of the Persian and Greek cultures has truly begun."
AG_STAT_MARRY_B		"Unfortunately, most Greeks back home don't see the wisdom of befriending the Persian 'barbarians'. Your popularity in Greece plummets. Diplomatic setbacks there will surely follow."
AG_STAT_WAIT		"There is no doubt that time and your growing fame will change Stateira's mind. She really has no other choice, since you control her fate. Eventually she will signal a newfound love of your greatness."
AG_STAT_MARRY2		"Good news! Stateira is ready and willing to be your wife. To marry into the Persian royal family, you must follow the proper ritual and spectacle, which will cost 5000 gold. Time has reduced opposition to the marriage in Greece, but there still will be critics... Will you marry her?"
AG_STAT_MARRY3		"Statiera complains that her biological clock is ticking. You have the 5000 gold required for the wedding ceremony. Will you marry her?"

# Bessus Uprising
AG_BESSUS		"Despite the lack of any royal blood in his veins, the Persian General Bessus has declared himself to be the new Emperor of Persia. He declares that he will continue the Persian resistance and vows to seek revenge for Darius' death."
AG_BESSUS2		"Despite the lack of any royal blood in his veins, the Persian General Bessus has declared himself to be the new Emperor of Persia. He declares that he will continue the Persian resistance and vows to seek revenge for the death of Darius and his family."

# Arabia Strings
AG_ARABIA_ROAD		"Travel far down this broken trail and you will reach the lands of Southern Arabia, made rich from the spice trade. However, the journey down this road is dangerous for those not used to the rough ways of the desert. Also, be wary of the fiercely independent and violent barbarians found here."
AG_MARIB		"You have found the legendary city of Marib! The exact location of this spice center was never known to outsiders. Trade wealth has allowed a surprisingly large town to exist on the edge of a hostile desert. Southern Arabia is the only source in the world for incense spices, so the town has profited greatly."
AG_MARIB_CONQUER	"You have conquered Marib! Centuries of trade profits have been piled into great hordes of wealth. 10,000 gold, and all of this is now yours!"
AG_SHABWAH_CONQUER	"You have conquered Shabwah! While not as big or rich as legendary Marib, Shabwah has significant secret stores of trade profits that are now yours. You are 6,000 gold richer!"
AG_DHUFAR_CONQUER	"You have conquered Dhufar! While not as big or rich as legendary Marib, Dhufar also has a significant treasury from trade profits. You find 3,000 gold!"

# Carthaginian Strings
AG_CARTHAGE		"Your armies are nearing the city of Carthage, the only important city in the Carthaginian empire. The rest are mere trading arms of this mighty city. The city is defended as well as any, however. It might take a long siege to win here."
AG_CARTHAGE_CONQUER	"The great city of Carthage has been conquered! Now that you control this strategically located city, surely the rest of the Western Mediterrean Sea will crumble in your hands like dried sod. A trove of 3000 gold has been found!"

# Seres Strings
AG_SERES		"You have entered Seres, the land of silk. This fabulous land has never even been guessed at by Greeks until your armies found it. There are a few nearby oasis towns, but the heart of Seres (what history will later call China) lies far to the east, over many forbidding deserts and mountains."
AG_SERES2		"You are leaving the prosperous oasis towns to search for the heart of Seres. Turn back now: you will never make it. The deserts are too barren to supply an army. Only small bands of daring merchants make the journey there and back alive... sometimes."

# India Strings
AG_INDIA_ROUTE		"You have found the southern route between India and Persia. It would make sense that one could sail from here to the seas near Bablyon or even all the way to Egypt, but such routes have been long forgotten. Perhaps one of your greatest legacies will be restarting the ocean trade between India and the West."
AG_INDIA_ROUTE2		"You have started along the central route between India and Persia. This is a very difficult route, and a safe way between harsh terrain of mountain and desert hard to find."
AG_INDIA_ROUTE3		"You have found the northern route between India and Persia. This part of the world is the stuff of legend and fantasy to your fellow Greeks. The Persians once ruled a tiny corner of this vast land, but beyond vague rumors from the Persians, your armies are the first to bring this rich land into the known world."
AG_CROSSROADS		"You have reached an important crossroads. The road northeast runs straight to the land of Sogdia, the traditional northeast corner of the Persian Empire. The road south runs generally southeast and then northwest, until it finally reaches other roads to India and Sogdia. The road west eventually heads all the way back to Greece."
AG_WILDERNESS		"You are entering increasingly wild and hostile lands. This is the only road that traditionally connects Persia with her far flung eastern colonies. There are great deserts to the north and south, and many fierce barbarians attack out of them."
AG_TAKSASILA_A		"The Gods smile upon you: the giant city of Taksasila has willingly joined your empire! Situated at the edge of India, traders have brought here news of your great military successes, and the leader of Taksasila does not want to stand against you. This city can be a tremendously valuable foothold in India."
AG_TAKSASILA_B		"Unfortunately, other nearby cities are not so receptive. Just beyond Taksasila, the rivals of that city are already preparing their armies to drive you out of India before you create a foothold. In particular, there is a brilliant general called Porus who hopes to block your way."
AG_TAKSASILA2_A		"The friendly people of Taksasila have much information to share with you about what the rest of India is like. The river just to the west of Taksasila is called the Indus. It flows through deserts down into the sea. Many independent city states exist along it and its branches. Each one acts independent of the others."
AG_TAKSASILA2_B		"If you head southeast out of the city, you will eventually come to another large river with many branches, called the Ganges. There are many large cities in the fertile Ganges river plain, but they are all controlled by the Magadhan Empire."
AG_TAKSASILA2_C		"Indian armies everywhere are known for two things: their archers, and their elephants. Beware especially of the elephants. There is no military force in the world as strong as an army with many giant elephants!"
AG_MAGADHAN		"Your army hears reports of a vast land to the east ruled by the Magadhans. Massive rivers run east into the Great Circling Sea. If you follow these rivers you will come to the capital of Pataliputra, filled with wealth beyond imagining. The Magadhan army is also legendary, with countless war elephants."
AG_MAGADHAN2		"Now that you are entering the heart of the Magadhan Empire, you hear rumors all is not well there. The Emperor Dhana Nanda is a commoner who stole the throne, and is widely hated by his people. Apparently the Empire is a hollow echo of its former glory. It still has vast resources at its command, however."
AG_SOUTH_INDIA		"Scouts report you are now entering Southern India. This is a very rugged land, with few roads. It is filled with independent city states that have never been conquered by any empire."
AG_MAGADHAN_FLEE	"Seeing you come to in person to conquer their city, the Magadhan garrison realizes it is no match for your might and they flee into the countryside."
AG_KAUSAMBI		"With the conquest of Kausambi, other nearby cities are quick to detach themselves from the crumbling Magadhan Empire, and join the winning side."
AG_UJJAYINI		"With the conquest of the regional center of Ujjayini, the city of Bharuch is quick to detach itself from the crumbling Magadhan Empire, and join the winning side."
AG_PATALIPUTRA_A	"You have conquered the Magadhan capital! Emperor Dhana Nanda flees to the remnants of his once great empire. But surely the back of the Magadhan Empire has been broken. Dhana Nanda was notorious for stealing from his own people, and indeed you find a huge treasure: 8000 gold."
AG_PATALIPUTRA_B	"With the conquest of Pataliputra, surely it won't be long until all of the Magadhan Empire has fallen under your sway. Nearby cities desert to you, their faith in Magadhan power long gone."
AG_KASI			"You have conquered one of the most sacred cities in the world. A very holy man named Buddha gave his first sermon here. The city has countless temples dedicated to him and the religion of the Brahamans. You command philosophers from Greece to come here and learn from the many wise men of this city."
AG_CHANDRA_RUMOR	"There is unrest in the region of Pataliputra. Rumors tell of a charismatic young leader organizing a revolution. We'd best be on our guard for a possible uprising."
AG_CHANDRA		"A new force has arisen in India! Chandragupta, a brilliant young general, has raised {action[0].text}! His desire for great conquest comes from what he has learned of your exploits. {action[1].text}"
AG_CHANDRA_PT1A		"an army and plans to finish off the Magadhan Empire"
AG_CHANDRA_PT2A		"a rebel army and vows to rid India of all Macedonians"
AG_CHANDRA_PT2B		"Your garrison in Pataliputra is taken by surprise and massacred."
AG_CHANDRA_OLD		"The great General Chandragupta has died of a tropical disease! With him die the best hopes for a unification of all India by an Indian. For a short time he electrified his people with vision and action. This brilliant man could have been the Indian Alexander had he lived."
AG_CHANDRA_DEAD		"The great General Chandragupta has been killed in battle! With him die the best hopes for a unification of all India by an Indian. For a short time he electrified his people with vision and action. This brilliant man could have been the Indian Alexander had he lived."

# Sindu
AG_SINDU		"Your recent victory encouraged some Magadhan royalty to make a secret deal. They wish to offer you Sindu, the beautiful daughter of the former Emperor ousted by Dhana Nanda. Marry her, restore the true royal line, and many people in this land will accept your rule. They want 6000 Gold to seal the deal."
AG_SINDU_MARRY		"You marry Sindu now so Magadhan people will immediately come to your side. The splendor of the wedding is beyond belief. The deal you've made is very expensive, but Sindu's relatives promise to ensure the peoples' loyalty by spreading pro-Macedonian propaganda through the Magadhan cities you conquer."
AG_SINDU_NOMONEY	"Sindu's relatives say: 'Your words are big, but you obviously don't have the gold to back it up. You cannot be trusted. The marriage deal is off!"
AG_SINDU_NOMARRY	"You don't need their help for that price. The Magadhan people will have to accept you as their new ruler, regardless of who you are married to."

# Sogdia Strings
AG_SOGDIA_ENTER		"You are now entering Sogdia, a strip of fertile land caught between desolate deserts on one side, and a large mountain range in the other. The people in this land are very hardy, warlike and rebellious. Persia had a difficult time maintaining control here. Barbarians are a constant threat in this difficult land."
AG_SOGDIA_REBEL		"The people of Sogdia rebel! Rightly fearing that the Macedonians will force them to adopt their ways, the leaders of Sogdia decide their only chance is to strike before your armies have completely consolidated control of the region. They surprise and slaughter the garrisons in the cities you control."
AG_SOGDIA_REPORT	"The Sogdians seem to have an endless capacity to rebel. The only way to end the rebellion for certain is to defeat the rebel leaders. Scouts recently discovered that control of the rebellion has just been transferred to the northeastern city of Kyreskhata."

# Roxane
AG_SOGDIA_DEFEAT_A	"The Sogdian resistance base has been captured! All of the last surviving rebels leaders and their families were hiding here and have been captured alive. These families are virtually all that remains of the Sogdian nobility."
AG_SOGDIA_DEFEAT_B	"Conquering Kyreskhata has been a deadly blow to the Sogdian rebellion, but there is still a chance these people may rise again. The most certain method would be to kill the remaining Sogdian nobility so no one can lead the next rebellion."
AG_SOGDIA_DEFEAT_C	"Alternately, you can solve the problem by marrying into Sogdian royalty. One of the rebel's daughters is named Roxane. She is one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen. She would be the one to marry, but would that satisfy the restless Sogdians?  What will you do?"
AG_SOGDIA_KILL		"After such impressive conquest of their rebel base and complete destruction of the leadership, the Sogdians are properly cowed. They will never rise in rebellion again. But you may still have trouble from the remaining scattered barbarians."
AG_ROXANE_MARRY		"You marry Roxane a few days later. Time will tell if marrying Roxane will end the rebellion. But you have no doubt the marriage will go well. All who see her say she is the most beautiful woman they've ever seen, and what started as a marriage of convenience has rapidly turned into a true romance."
AG_SOGDIA_BRIBE		"Scouts report that despite your mercy and marriage to Roxane, most of the Sogdian rebel leaders you freed are plotting rebellion again. Perhaps some smartly placed "gifts" to these troublesome leaders will quiet them once and for all. 1000 gold should do the trick, if you have it. Bribe the rebel leaders?"
AG_SOGDIA_BRIBE_YES	"Money talks. The Sogdian nobility are willing to forgive and forget and the people have had enough of war."
AG_SOGDIA_BRIBE_NO	"There is now no end in sight to this horrible Sogdian rebellion. Your only choices in keeping the peace are stationing Generals in the Sogdian cities, or tearing the cities down."
AG_SOGDIA_BRIBE_NSF	"Sorry, you don't have 1000 gold to give! There is now no end in sight to this horrible Sogdian rebellion. Your only choices in keeping the peace are permanently stationing Generals in the Sogdian cities, or tearing the cities down."

AG_PREGNANT2		"You receive word that your wife {action[0].text} is pregnant. You are hoping for a boy again, since you badly need an heir, and children can so easily die of disease."
AG_ITS_A_GIRL		"Your wife {action[0].text} has come to term and given birth to a daughter. While your new child will bring you much joy in the years to come, she will not satisfy the Macedonian elite, who will only accept a boy as your royal heir. You mask your disappointment and resolve to try as many times as necessary to produce a son."
AG_ITS_A_GIRL2		"Your wife {action[0].text} has come to term and given birth to a daughter. While your new child will bring you much joy in the years to come, she does not matter politically since a female could never become king in Macedonia."
AG_ITS_A_BOY		"Your wife {action[0].text} has given birth to a son! Since you are the third king of Macedonia with the name Alexander, you give him the name Alexander IV. As word of the new heir spreads across your Empire, there is much celebration and rejoicing. You pray to the Gods that you will live long enough to raise him to succeed you."
AG_ITS_A_BOY2		"Your wife {action[0].text} has given birth to a son! You decide to name him Hephaestion II, in honor of your closest friend.

AG_SON3_BIRTHDAY	"Your son Philip II turns {sonAge[2]} today. After the deaths of Alexander IV and Hephaestion II, you pray that cruel fate will not strike a third time."
AG_SON1_DISEASE		"A herald brings tragic news: your son Alexander IV has just died of a sudden, high fever. You are inconsolable, and cry like a child. Hopes for an heir will have to turn to younger children."
AG_SON2_DISEASE		"A herald brings tragic news: your second son Hephaestion II has just died after a sudden illness. While this is a grievous blow, you are consoled by the fact that his older brother and heir to the throne, Alexander IV, still lives."
AG_SON1_2_DISEASE	"A herald brings tragic news: your second son Hephaestion II has just died after a sudden illness. This is a greivous blow, given the earlier death of Alexander IV in a similar manner. Why do the Gods curse you and cruelly deny you an heir?"
AG_SON_TWELVE_A		"Today your son Alexander IV turns twelve years old! Many children die of disease while they are young and vulnerable, but it is clear your son is now old enough and strong enough to grow into manhood. Powerful Macedonians who secretly harbored the desire to succeed you now throw away their dreams, and pledge eternal loyalty to you and your son."
AG_SON_TWELVE_B		"The celebration of your son's twelfth birthday outshines any celebration ever seen by the Greeks. Your heart swells with pride as you watch him give a speech to the soldiers thanking them for their gifts and for their loyalty and bravery. Here is a son who is worthy to be Emperor!{action[0].text}"
AG_SON2_TWELVE_A	"Today your son Hephaestion II turns twelve years old!

Powerful Macedonians who secretly harbored the desire to succeed you now throw away their dreams, and pledge eternal loyalty to you and your son."
AG_SON3_TWELVE_A	"Today your son Philip II turns twelve years old! It was a great worry that he would die like his brothers before him, but it is clear he is now old enough and strong enough to grow into manhood.

# Conquest Strings
AG_LEAD_DEFEAT		"Barbarians across the world beat on their shields to mourn the defeat of one of the great Barbarian Leaders. The number of Barbarian Leaders has been reduced to {barbNum}."
AG_BARB_DEFEAT		"The last of the great Barbarian leaders that have plagued the civilized world with their raiding and pillaging has been defeated. Without their leaders, these barbarians will pose little threat."
AG_CL_DEFEAT		"The Corinthian League forgot the lessons of the past and have paid for their foolishness in blood and conquest. Since they could not be content with accepting your guidance as allies, they had to be brought under direct control."
AG_GREEK_DEFEAT		"All the independent Greek cities have been conquered! The idea of the independent Greek city-state is no longer. Single cities stand no chance against larger empires like yours."
AG_PERSIA_DEFEAT	"The Persian Empire has been brought completely under your power. You are bursting with pride over finally making your father's dream a reality. Persia is yours, and it seems none can challenge your power."
AG_CARTHAGE_DEFEAT	"The Carthaginian civilization has been destroyed! You have conquered the entire Western Mediterranean Sea. You vow that in the very near future, you will build a road along the North African coastline, all the way from Egypt to the edge of the great ocean. Perhaps someday your sailors will explore that ocean and conquer lands beyond it."
AG_ROMAN_DEFEAT		"The Roman civilization has been brought to heel. Before you came along, the Romans seemed primed for greatness, but now they will be just one more province in your vast empire. Who knows what might have been had you left these vigorous people to their own devices. "
AG_MAGADHAN_DEFEAT	"You have destroyed the Magadhan Empire! Emperor Dhana Nanda is beheaded by his own people in punishment for his unjust rule. Dhana Nanda stole rapaciously from his own people. You would be greatly loved if you give back most of this money. 5000 gold would satisfy the people, making them love you even more."
AG_MAGADHAN_MONEY	"The former Magadhan people appreciate your generosity. In the larger cities they look upon your rule much more favorably."
AG_MAGADHAN_NOMONEY	"Sorry, the people are not fooled. Your promises are as empty as your treasury. Where is the money you promised them?"
AG_INDEP_DEFEAT		"You've finally mopped up all of the far-flung Independent States. The only serious obstacle to defeating these small independent states was distance, but even that could not stop you. The notion of an independent state is outdated: all civilized people will live in harmony under one government - yours."

AG_UNWORTHY		"So much opportunity; the Macedonian civilization seemed ready to do great things. Yet you failed to take advantage of it. Historians will ask what might have been, had Alexander been a better man. Your name will go down in the history as Alexander the Unworthy!"
AG_GOOD			"You have managed to enlarge the Macedonian civilization some, but there is so much more you could have done!  Most importantly, you did not give enough thought to creating an heir early in your career. History books will call you not Alexander the Great, but merely Alexander the Good."
AG_MIGHTY		"Your accomplishments are many, but you didn't hold enough territory long enough to create a truly lasting empire. Your work will be undone by your less competent successors. Still, you have changed world history dramatically, and your works will be long remembered. Historians will call you Alexander the Mighty."
AG_GREAT		"Congratulations! You proved yourself to be a worthy match to the real Alexander the Great. But the real Alexander died so young and failed to provide for a sucesssor. Your empire is more likely to survive your death than his. For your many accomplishments, historians will refer to you as Alexander the Great."
AG_MAGNIFICENT		"You have outdone the real Alexander the Great! You did more than him to provide an heir. Because of your great reputation, your empire will survive your death. A succession of Alexanders will follow in your footsteps. Historians will refer to you as Alexander the Magnificent."
AG_DEMIGOD		"Your accomplishments far outshine those of the real Alexander! You have conquered nearly all of the known world and provided for an heir. Thousands of years later, you're still considered a pivotal figure in history, the man who created a lasting world empire. Some go even further and worship you as part god."
AG_GOD			"Unbelievable: you have conquered the entire known world! In future generations other Alexanders will see your empire spread across the entire world, and into space within 1000 years. You are looked upon as more than an empire founder, but are widely worshipped throughout the stars as a God who came to Earth!"

# Various extra strings
AG_PERSEP_ROAD 		"Scouts report you are now on the road between Susa and Persepolis, the winter and summer capitols of the Persian Empire."
AG_MACEDHAPPY 		"Word of your defeat of Darius has spread amongst the people back in the Macedonian homeland. Your popularity soars in Pella and nearby cities, as the magnitude of what you've done sinks in."
AG_NEAR_CROSSROAD	"You stand at a major crossroad. Go north over high mountains, and you will enter Sogdia, the traditional northwestern frontier of the Persian Empire. Go south over high mountains, and you will find a series of oasis towns that eventually connect to the main road leading west. Go east, and you will enter the fabled land of India."
AG_CASPIAN_GATE		"You are crossing the Caspian Gate. This passage between mountain and desert marks the boundary between the more civilized lands to the west and the wild, desolate lands to the east. In the east, fertile lands are few and far between, until this road eventually comes to distant India."
AG_ETHIOPIA		"The river Nile flows south to the rich kingdom of Meroe, and the highlands of Ethiopia."
AG_MEROE		"You have conquered Meroe! This area has been one of the world's largest producers of gold. 5000 gold is yours for the taking."
AG_ARABIA_BY_SEA1	"Your ships have discovered the coastal waters of Arabia. This desert land is filled with fiercely independent and violent barbarians. But it would certainly be worth conquering the fantastically rich trade cities of Southern Arabia. An ocean voyage along Arabia's coast would eventually bring you to Egypt."
AG_ARABIA_BY_SEA2	"Your ships are at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf. To the east you will find Arabia. This desert land is filled with fiercely independent and violent barbarians. But it would certainly be worth conquering the fantastically rich trade cities of Southern Arabia. An ocean voyage along Arabia's coast would eventually bring you to Persia."
AG_ROAD_TO_MARIB1	"Spice caravans follow this trail inland to the city of Marib, which some say is the richest city in the world."
AG_ROAD_TO_MARIB2	"There is a trail leading over mountains to the magnificent city of Marib, center of the spice trade."
AG_EGYPT_DEFECT_A	"The natives of Egypt joyously celebrate the arrival of the great Alexander! The Egyptians had repeatedly rebelled against the Persians in the last century, only to be reconquered. Egyptians now look to you as their salvation, and throw off the Persian yoke! Persian soldiers flee, leaving you with a land nearly destroyed by so many rebellions."
AG_EGYPT_DEFECT_B	"The Egyptians will only accept Pharohs as their leaders. If you go Memphis and take part in a coronation as Pharoh there, you will find the job of controlling Egypt much easier."
AG_EGYPT_HAPPY		"In a massive ceremony, you are dressed like an ancient Pharoh and proclaimed to be a God-king. Common Egyptians believe Ammon-Ra is your father and your popularity here is boosted. Outside Egypt you are still regarded as only a Macedonian king."
AG_BABYLON		"Babylon is one of the four traditional royal homes of the Persian Emperors. But only because of its large size and wealth; people here have no love for the Persians."
AG_ECBATANA		"Ecbatana is one of the four traditional royal homes of the Persian Emperors. As a result, there is a large treasure there to pay for the Emperor's luxurious living." 
AG_SYRACUSE		"Many have tried to conquer Syracuse, and all have failed. Athens was a great power until its military was destroyed trying to conquer Syracuse. High city walls and a very defensible location are what makes this city so hard to conquer." 
AG_ATHENS		"Athens is possibly the most wonderous city in the world. The scientific acumen of the Athenians is represented by the Aristotle's Lyceum wonder. The city's defenses are very tough." 
AG_SPARTA		"Sparta has been the only city in Greece to laugh in your face, and stay out of the Corinithian League. Because of Sparta's mountainous terrain and high city walls, they have no fear of anyone, not even Alexander." 
AG_PERSEPOLIS		"Persepolis is one of the four traditional royal homes of the Persian Emperors. It is also the center of the original Persian homeland, and therefore has the largest and most luxurious palaces and treasures of any Persian city." 
AG_SUSA			"Susa is one of the four royal homes of the Persian Emperors. As a result, there is a large treasure there to pay for the Emperor's luxurious living. This is also the starting point for the famous Persian Royal Road, represented by the Appian Way wonder." 
AG_ROME			"Despite a poor strategic location, Rome has grown into a surprisingly large city. Wise government is making this city great. The city's leadership has also developed the city walls into a formidable barrier." 
AG_PERSEPOLIS2		"The conquest of the homeland of the Persians certainly spells doom for the Persian Empire. The Persians are impressed that you pay homage at the tomb of Cyrus the Great, founder of Persia, but not so impressed that you're confiscating the 15,000 gold treasure in the city! This must be the largest gold horde ever amassed in the whole world!"
AG_SUSA2		"As one of the homes of Persian Emperors, Susa has a large gold horde. The treasure of 4000 gold is now yours to spend!"
AG_ECBATANA2		"As one of the homes of Persian Emperors, Ecbatana has a large gold horde. 4000 gold is now yours! Why the Persians didn't spend this money to pay for more soldiers is a mystery."
AG_BABYLON2		"The great Babylon is now yours! So is the large gold fortune of 5000 gold, amassed here to pay for the luxuries of the Persian royalty. The central position of Bablyon makes it the natural location from which to rule your conquests."
AG_ATHENS2		"The mighty city of Athens is now under your control! However, the fact that you had to conquer this city with brute force and damage its many treasures instead of holding the Corinthian League alliance lowers your reputation amongst neighboring countries." 
AG_PERSIANS_DEAD	"Now that you have completely conquered the Persian Empire, there is no hope for any would be pretender Persian Emperors. The people of Persia are ready to proclaim you their new emperor once you return to Bablyon for the coronation ceremony."
AG_HAPPY_EMPIRE		"In a massive ceremony, you declare the eternal unity of the Greek and Persian worlds, and declare yourself the Emperor of Persia, the King of Kings! In cities long held by Persia, your popularity is boosted, but the Greeks are skeptical of this unity idea, and dislike your friendship with any non-Greek 'barbarians'."
AG_SPARTA_DEFECT	"Your reputation amongst the Greeks has been falling. Though this isn't enough to cause trouble with the Greek civilization as a whole, the Spartans decide to join the Persian side, hoping other Greek cities will follow their example! Sparta is now essentially a part of Persia, and ready to attack the Corinthian League."
AG_REALLY_HAPPY_EMPIRE	"Your empire now stretches from Carthage and Rome in the west to India in the east! The realization by the masses that you already are the greatest conqueror of all time boosts your popularity in all of your cities!"
AG_PERSIAN_FLEE		"The mere presence of Alexander at their gates causes the city's defenders to flee, leaving an open city."

# Additional leader death strings
AG_PORUS_OLD		"Scouts report that the Indian General Porus has died, though it is not known how. Too bad- such a famous man could have been a useful ally or worthy adversary."
AG_PORUS_BATTLE		"You have defeated the great General Porus! For many years he was the strongest Indian military power outside of the large Magadhan Empire, but he was no match for your military genious. Too bad this man was your enemy because he fought brilliantly. Refusing to die, he cut down dozens of your men before many wounds finally finished him off."
AG_MEMNON_OLD		"The Persians have lost Memnon, their best general. He was quickly wiped out by disease. You should consider yourself very lucky to have him die before having to face him in battle."
AG_MEMNON_BATTLE	"The Persians have lost Memnon, their best general. He was struck down in battle by angry Greeks, eager to kill the traitor who fought against his own people. With his death, your conquests should now be much easier."
AG_BESSUS_OLD		"The Persian general Bessus has been killed by his own men! Because Bessus did not have the proper royal credentials like Darius did, others thought they could do better than him and tried to take over. But Persian leadership is only more divided now."
AG_BESSUS_BATTLE	"The Persian general Bessus dies in battle! With his death, there is no single person remaining with any hopes of rallying the Persian people to defeat you."
