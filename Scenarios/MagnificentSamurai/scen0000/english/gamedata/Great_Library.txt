Advanced Composites, the most powerful of all plastics, were one of the most important discoveries of the late 20th century. Although the invention of plastics revolutionized manufacturing in the 20th century, advanced aeronautics and space flight demanded materials that were lighter, and at the same time stronger, than conventional metals.  Ceramics, carbon fiber, resin and injected-foam molding comprise many of the composites that make space travel and stealth technology possible.

[ADVANCE_ADV_INFANTRY_TACTICS_HISTORICAL]
Infantry have always been the backbone of any military operation.  However, traditional infantrymen only had their own feet as a means of transportation.  In the early-to-mid 20th century, advanced infantry tactics took advantage of new technological developments to extend the range and flexibility of the modern infantryman.

Aircraft allowed infantry to deploy by air, as paratroopers, to penetrate deep behind enemy lines.  They could be used to interrupt supply lines, strike command centers, conduct reconnaissance and, perhaps most important, capture and hold crucial objectives like bridges and key terrain.  Aircraft also enabled infantry to deploy quickly over a larger area.  Paratroopers and airmobile forces became vital to peacekeeping and humanitarian missions beyond the reach of conventional, land-based transportation.

World War II saw a rise in the use of amphibious landing craft, allowing "marines" to deploy by sea to assault coastal targets.  One of the most famous and successful military operations to rely heavily on amphibious assault was the allied invasion of Normandy, which led to the liberation of Europe and the end of the war.

These advances served to enhance the versatility of infantry, making them better able to serve their most vital function: to engage and destroy the enemy at close range, over any terrain, in any weather, by day or night.

[ADVANCE_ADV_NAVAL_TACTICS_HISTORICAL]
The high seas of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the setting for the swift advance of Naval Tactics and warfare.  Navies abandoned the wooden-hulls and sails of ships-of-the-line in favor of engine powered, metal-hulled battleships and cruisers. Combining large size, powerful guns, and heavy armor with speed, strength and range, battleships were the unrivaled capital ships of the world's navies for nearly a century after they were first introduced in 1860.  

World War II was the battleship's heyday, when the Washington Treaty of 1922, which limited battleship sizes to 35,000 tons of displacement, was abandoned.  The United States, Germany and Japan built 45,000-ton Iowa class, 52,600-ton Bismarck class and 72,000-ton Yamato class battleships, respectively.  They employed antiaircraft weapons, 5-inch caliber rapid-fire guns and a multitude of 20 to 40 mm automatic weapons.  They could travel great distances at the relatively high speed of over 30 knots.  This period of dominance came to a swift end, however, with the rapid development of the aircraft carrier, the range and striking power of which relegated the battleship to coastal bombardment and carrier escort duties.  The United States continued to employ World War II-era battleships in the latter 20th century, finally retiring the Wisconsin and the Missouri, the two remaining Iowa-class ships, after service in the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s.

[ADVANCE_ADV_URBAN_PLANNING_HISTORICAL]
It was the disorder and squalor of 19th century Industrial Revolution-era cities, with their festering, overcrowded slums, which prompted the first modern urban planning and development efforts.  Early city planners imposed laws for the standardization of housing, sewage, sanitation, public health and, perhaps most important, water supply conditions.  Urban planners also introduced parks and playgrounds into congested city neighborhoods, providing places for recreation, as well as visual relief.

20th century urban planning saw the rise of the concept of zoning -- setting limits for building height, neighborhood density and construction activity.  Most cities had grown organically, and as the Industrial Revolution shifted the role and dominance of cities to the fore, they became sprawling, disorganized eyesores, with commercial, industrial and residential areas intertwined and seemingly built on top of each other.

Public transportation was the answer to many issues -- overcrowding, complex street systems, traffic, congested commercial districts, and shortages of housing -- that plagued the sprawling metropolis.  Urban planning was also important to the revitalization of Europe after World War II, where planners shifted their focus to the reconstruction of areas destroyed by war.

By the middle of the 20th century, urban planners experimented with new concepts for towns and cities, and endeavored to create the ideal urban area.  "Planned communities" sprang up, with transportation, recreation, industrial and residential systems in place.  Rather than focusing on fixing problems, planners sought to develop urban areas that would evolve with the changing needs of their citizenry.  Though there have been spectacular failures, many planned cities are a testament to the wisdom of long-term, scalable urban plans that focus on the total living experience.

Few other breakthroughs in human history changed more aspects of human life than the discovery of flight.  For as long as history has been recorded, human beings have been fascinated with flight.  Great thinkers, even as early as Leonardo Da Vinci, have tried to come up with devices and contraptions to enable human beings to fly.  Inventors experimented with lighter-than-air craft in the 19th century, but were dogged by problems of control, safety, weather and range.  Military uses of lighter-than-air craft proved disastrous in World War I, as they were easily shot down.  In the early 1900's, two brothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, launched the first airplane at Kitty Hawk field in North Carolina.  This craft combined an internal combustion engine with the latest understandings of aerodynamics to make the first successful flight.  Although it was only in the air for 12 seconds, a modern revolution in transportation and aviation was born.  Human understanding about the nature of fixed-wing flight began to dramatically increase.  By World War I, the first military aircraft took to the skies and added a new dimension to warfare.  The modern reliance on aircraft and its applications in the realms of transportation, commerce, industry, recreation and war cannot be understated.

[ADVANCE_AGE_OF_REASON_HISTORICAL]
Although many people have called the 18th century the Age of Reason, the phrase is misleading.  Reason, and the exploration of rational thought, played a prominent role in many previous ages.  What granted the 18th century, particularly in England and France, the title was the prevalence of two main impulses:  reason and passion.  The celebration of reason is evident in the pursuit of order, symmetry, decorum and scientific knowledge that permeated the times.  The cultivation of passion gave rise to such things as philanthropy, religious fervor, intensification of personal relationships and an increase in interest in sentiment or sensibility.  Reason evidences itself in the literature of the times that employed satire, wit, argument and plain prose.  Passion, on the other hand, was expressed in sublime poetry and psychological novels.  

A combination of passion and reason was responsible for the criticism, and eventual vilification, of the institution of slavery.

New crop rotation techniques, better breeding methods and new mechanized devices for cultivation marked the period in the 18th century known as the agricultural revolution.  Simultaneous advances in hygiene and diets led to a rise in population, and provided both workers and consumers for these new manufacturing methods.  The Norfolk four-course system was one of the most important developments during this time.  Wheat was grown in the first year, followed by turnips in the second, then barley, with clover and ryegrass undersown, in the third.  The clover and ryegrass were grazed or cut for feed in the fourth year.  Turnips went to feed cows and sheep.  This system had enormous benefits, including the elimination of the fallow year, and richer, more abundant animal manure for fertilization.  This increased crop yields considerably.

The discovery of reliable methods for agriculture marked a major turning point in human evolution.  Animal husbandry and breeding increased the strength, supply and utility of livestock.  Early farming methods were subject to the whims of nature, as deviations in seasons and weather patterns could decrease the yield of, or simply wipe out, crops.  Early farmers would farm single pieces of land until fallow, which contributed to long periods of scarcity.  Although starvation was a constant threat, granaries enabled communities to store food through winters, droughts and fallow periods.  Regardless of the risks, farming prompted many cultures to abandon nomadic life and settle in one place.  Grassy lands near major water sources proved ideal.

[ADVANCE_AI_SURVEILLANCE_HISTORICAL]
Advancements in video technology, computer systems and artificial intelligence proliferated in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  The prevalence of private security systems in homes, businesses and institutions was not a new phenomenon.  However, in response to an increasingly strident public outcry at rising crime rates, many cities began to install security systems in public places.  These new systems employed sophisticated AI protocols to monitor activity and process any abnormalities.  At first, law enforcement efforts found the new AI surveillance systems a boon to their operations.  Crime rates dropped, due to enhanced criminal identification and apprehension efforts.

Some law enforcement advocates began to speculate on the potential uses for AI surveillance in private areas as well.  They pointed to their successes on the streets as proof of the system's worth and pressed law-makers to relax privacy laws in order to enable building owners to install surveillance systems in their buildings to monitor tenants.  What had become a positive solution to the problem of public-area crime became a nightmarish violation of privacy, as government and law enforcement now had the power to monitor people in their own homes.  The same public that demanded surveillance systems on the streets now found cameras in their homes.  Crime continued to drop, as people no longer had a place to hide their illicit activities.  But the constant invasion of privacy, once a right guaranteed by many civilized nations, had created an embittered and outraged public.

In 1969, one of the most well-known utopian city planners of the 20th century, Italian-born American architect Paolo Soleri introduced the concept of arcologies as a potential alternative to the sprawling cities of late-20th century America.  Coined from the words "architecture" and "ecology," arcologies were megastructures designed to conserve natural surroundings and spatially condense the human activities of working and living.  In his book Arcology:  The City in the Image of Man, he envisioned giant urban centers that extended vertically into the sky, rather than horizontally along the ground.

It was not until the middle of the 21st century that the overcrowding of cities reached such heights that arcologies became necessary.  Many beleaguered metropolises erected these towering structures within city limits, and, although Soleri's original vision of conserved nature was often sacrificed, arcologies enabled cities to house and serve increasing numbers of people.  Many arcology dwellers spent much of their lives within their own complex, for they wanted for little that the arcology could not provide.

[ADVANCE_BALLISTICS_HISTORICAL]
Ballistics is the development of mechanical devices that hurl projectiles several times faster than could be attained by throwing.  The most famous of these, the bow and arrow, traces back to prehistoric times, where it was a primary weapon of war and the hunt.  The earliest bows consisted of a thin length of wood fastened with string or sinew at each end.  Later, bows were made of several materials, including wood and horn glued together and reinforced with bands of sinew.  The English longbow, made of wood from the yew tree, was famous in battle, helping win battles over the French at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt during the Hundred Years' War.  Other cultures employed the bow in war, hunting and recreational archery, including the Egyptians, Assyrians, Chinese, Goths and Mongols.  Accounts of Renaissance-era European travelers indicate that the bow and arrow was the weapon of choice on virtually every continent.

Ballistae were ancient heavy missile launchers used to hurl large bolts, javelins or heavy balls great distances.  Smaller ballistae, like those in ballista towers, were essentially large crossbows fastened to a mount.  The Roman ballista, by contrast, was an enormous contraption, powered by torsion derived from two thick skeins of twisted cords through which were thrust two separate arms joined at their ends by the cord that propelled the missile.  The largest ballistae could hurl 60-pound weights up to 500 yards, and were devastatingly accurate siege weapons.  The smaller ballistae were better suited to defense against siege weapons and infantry attacks and were often perched high on the towers of towns and castles to rain a variety of projectiles on charging armies.

The introduction of gunpowder gradually made the bow and ballista obsolete, as Western armies rushed to outfit themselves with the more powerful firearms and cannon.  By the late 16th century, firearms had supplanted bows and arrows in all but the Far East, Africa and South America.

Without a way to mitigate the risk of piracy, a merchant could lose his or her livelihood with the destruction of his or her caravan.  Banking helped to change this by splitting risk between bank and merchant.  The Romans developed banking into a robust system of mortgages, loans, and credits. With banking, capital was available to expand trade and spread commerce widely.

This new alloy was strong, light and its raw materials were plentiful.  The Greeks and Spartans found many uses for bronze, most notably for armor and weaponry.

The invention of cannon is generally credited to a German monk, Berthold Schwarz (flourished early 14th century). The first cannon used gunpowder charges to fire stones or metal balls. Early cannon were smoothbore metal tubes loaded from the muzzle and aimed and elevated manually; recoil was absorbed by allowing the carriage to run backward.  The discovery of gunpowder prompted a renewed interest in metallurgy as nations sought to develop more dependable and more accurate gun barrels. As often is the case, this research borrowed heavily from non-military fields.  Turning to the blast furnace (a coal furnace developed in the 17th century for glassmaking) to cast the iron, nations were able to make stronger, lighter iron cannons. These cannons replaced their bronze barreled predecessors, and artillery gained further prominence on the battlefield.

Rows of mounted soldiers, a few men abreast by ten men deep, would fire a row at a time fading back into the rear of the formation to allow the next group to attack.

[ADVANCE_CHAOS_THEORY_HISTORICAL]
The dynamic nature of the universe has led to a great deal of scientific research dedicated to analyzing change.  Until the late 20th century, scientists believed that random external influences were the source of system dynamics behaving unpredictably.  If they could eliminate random influences, they, in theory, could predict the behavior of deterministic systems indefinitely.  It is known that, even in the absence of external influences, systems can exhibit long-term unpredictability.  These systems are called chaotic.  What's more, chaotic systems appear to the casual observer to exhibit random, irregular behavior, when in fact they are mathematically deterministic, following precise laws.

Chaos Theory attempts to explain the complex and unpredictable dynamics of chaotic systems that are sensitive to such initial conditions as velocity and position.  Two chaotic systems with identical dynamics but different initial conditions can quickly exhibit markedly different behavior.  The French mathematician Henri Poincaré stated what became a central tenet of chaos theory:  "It may happen that small differences in the initial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena. A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the latter. Prediction becomes impossible...."  Chaos is inherent in systems as varied as electric circuits, lasers, heart rhythms, fluids, chemical reactions and animal populations.  Some chaos theorists suspect that complex economic systems, such as stock exchanges, may be chaotic.  

As the field of chaos evolved rapidly from a theoretical to an applied science, scientists were able to harness its power to create applications that defied previously held theories about the limitations of physical space.  With the ability to model chaotic systems, scientist could predict the unpredictable leading to advances in a range of fields, including anti-gravity systems, global weather prediction and plasma physics.

As ancient societies expanded and became more complex, the need for a more educated populus increased.  Although ancient societies seldom, if ever, made education available to common people, the ruling classes, and some of the upper middle class, sent their children to schools run by the greatest thinkers of the day.  Although initially designed as facilities for training clergymen, universities opened their doors to secular study and emerged as centers of higher learning.  Universities specializing in law and medicine existed in France and Italy as early as 1100 AD.  With a highly educated ruling class, people engaged each other in higher-level pursuits, such as philosophy, theology and law.  The classical Greek and Roman schools, with their emphasis on rhetoric and critical thinking, produced exceptional writers, philosophers and statesmen.  It was the intellectual environment of these times that intrigued thinkers of the 15th and 16th centuries, prompting the Renaissance obsession with classical art, education, politics and culture.

[ADVANCE_COMMUNISM_HISTORICAL]
Although communal living and popular government were concepts that originated in ancient times, the socio-economic injustices of Western Europe's Industrial Revolution-era class structure spawned the first earnest political movement aimed at establishing a communist state.  In 1848, a Prussian sociologist and economist named Karl Marx penned, with Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto, a pamphlet outlining a plan to radically alter the government of labor, markets and the state.  Marx also wrote the communist movement's most important book, Das Kapital.  Although communism has had many developments, the fundamental idea of a society in which property was owned by the community and all citizens shared in the enjoyment of the common wealth according to their need.

Historically, communism had a hard time taking hold.  The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, lead by Vladmir Lenin, began the transformation of Russia into a communist state.  Although the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) lasted well into the 1990s, its success as a communist state was mixed.  Plagued by a host of problems both internal and external, the people of the USSR endured a series of dictatorships unrivaled in their oppressiveness.  After more than 70 years of attempts to establish a viable state, the communists lost power to more capitalist-minded leaders.  Smaller nations have experimented with communism throughout the 20th century, but capitalist nations, most notably the United States, succeeded in subverting and dismantling almost every attempt to establish a communist government.

Although computational machines, most notably the abacus, have been around for millennia, it was not until World War II that developments in advanced mechanical computational devices arrived.  The first computers were developed to crack encrypted German wartime communications.  Computers improved with advances in vacuum tube, transistor and integrated circuitry technology.  Computers found commercial and educational uses in the 1950s and '60s, fueling a revolution of epic proportions.  With the introduction of the first personal computers in the late 1970s, computers began to enhance peoples' abilities to perform many tasks, including document creation, mathematics and research.  Sales of personal computers skyrocketed in the 1980 and '90s as businesses, schools and institutions found their power and capabilities indispensable.

Concrete is one of the strongest, cheapest and most durable building materials available.  Its origins date back to the ancient Egyptians, who used lime and gypsum as binders and combined them with clay.  Lime (calcium oxide) continued to be the primary cement-forming agent until the early 19th century, when, in 1824, an English inventor Joseph Aspdin burned and ground together a mixture of limestone and clay.  This mixture, called portland cement, continues to be the dominant cementing agent used in concrete production.  When mixed with water, clay, large and small aggregates and a small amount of air, it is unmatched as building material.

The benefits of concrete are many.  It is castable in almost any form, and is fire resistant, making it ideal for building construction.  Concrete was easier to use than stone or marble because it could be mixed at the building site, and did not require resource-intensive transport operations.  Perhaps the greatest quality of concrete is its superior compression strength ability, supporting 10,000 or more pounds per square inch.  This is far greater than concrete's tensile strength, but with properly designed steel reinforcement, one can build structural elements that are as strong in tension as they are in compression.  Concrete columns built by the Egyptians around 1500 BC still standing in the year 2000 AD are a testament to concretes steadfast durability.

The various industrial revolutions across the world dramatically increased human society's harmful effects on the environment.  The invention of the internal combustion engine and the increase in reliance on fossil fuels took its toll on the world as well.  In the 1970s, Western nations began to expand their cities at rapid paces.  Centuries of relatively unmitigated industrial activity began to manifest in the form of increased waste products, smog and rivers poisoned with chemicals.  A popular movement to combat the rising tide of pollution began to grow.  The conservation movement succeeded in pushing for legislation to regulate industry and commerce and introduced new ideas for waste management into the public conversation.  In the 1980s, many cities and municipalities adopted community recycling as a viable solution to one aspect.  Public outcry at the destruction of the planet's ozone layer prompted bans on the use of chlorofluorocarbons in many industrialized nations.  Despite these changes, insufficiently enforced regulations, government corruption and lack of international standards allowed industry to continue its poisonous conduct.  The battle over the environment raged on well into the 21st century, with substantial sums of money on both sides attempting to influence public dialogue on the best solutions for the problem of pollution.

The late 20th century bore witness to the rise in power and influence of the private business corporation.  Particularly in the United States and Western Europe, corporations rode a wave of government deregulation and erosion of anti-trust legislation to unprecedented economic power.  Corporate campaign contributions to politicians began to steer legislators in the direction of preserving corporate interests at all costs, even at the expense of individual rights.

Though many international free trade agreements were hailed as bold new measures for the proliferation of trade and the bolstering of commerce, they only served to enable multinational corporations to take their manufacturing operations to third-world countries filled with cheap, exploitable labor.  Corporate control of all major media outlets, including network and cable television, radio, newspapers and magazines helped shield the public from their agenda.  Because modern society relied so much on media sources such as nightly news reports, they often failed to get independent, impartial journalism about corporate conduct in politics.  Despite sporadic outbreaks of civil unrest in early 2000, popular elections continued to be dominated by corporate-sponsored candidates who further advance the agenda of their private benefactors, and the gap between rich and poor continued to widen across the world.

The modern, private business corporation gradually formed out of a fusion of the joint-stock company and the medieval form of a corporation in the 19th century. This fusion took place in Great Britain, the United States, France and Germany with laws that made incorporation more or less standard for business entities.  This development took flight particularly in the United States, because its Constitution delegated the powers of incorporation to the individual states.  This prompted a competition in the late 19th century amongst states to liberalize their incorporation laws, since free interstate commerce, guaranteed by the Constitution, allowed would-be incorporators to choose the state in which they wished to incorporate without infringing on their freedom to transact business in any other state.  The 20th century saw the emergence of private corporations as major political, social and economic forces.

[ADVANCE_CRIMINAL_CODE_HISTORICAL]
Crime is an arbitrary concept, in that it is entirely constructed based on the moral and ethical laws of a people.  What is lawful in one country may be criminal in another, and trivial infractions in one cultural context may be capital crimes elsewhere.  As times and social mores change, so do criminal codes.  In addition, as technology grows, a code must expand to cover the new range of potential opportunities that each development makes available for abuse.  The invention of the motor vehicle, for example, led to the development of an entire body of criminal laws designed to regulate its use.

The development of a criminal code is essential for a just society to function.  However, the malleability of law predicates the need for a class of full-time professionals whose avocation is the study, interpretation and enactment of law.  Although professional lawyers had been around since ancient times, the early 20th century saw a dramatic rise in the ranks of lawyers and lawmakers around the world.  As society, particularly the business and technological parts of it, became more complex, and the potential for abuse increased dramatically, the modern criminal code has evolved and expanded to meet the needs of due process.  Moreover, as criminal populations increase, the need for prisons and correctional facilities rises.

The term cybernetics derived from the Greek word kybernetes, meaning "pilot" or "governor."  An interdisciplinary science primarily concerned with the study of communication and control theory in living organisms, machines and organizations, cybernetics investigated the techniques by which information is transformed into desired performance.  It was initially a response to problems encountered in post-World War II military applications of so-called electronic brains and automated control systems.

In cybernetics, the systems of communication and control are considered the same in living organisms as well as machines.  In order to achieve desired performance results consistently, a system must make available data concerning the actual results of the intended action, to act as a guide for future action.  In the human body, the central nervous system coordinates such information, which is used to determine future courses of action.  In machines, self-correction mechanisms serve the same purpose.  This system of information processing is known as feedback, which is the fundamental concept of automation.

The world did not start seeing significant applications of cybernetics until well into the 22nd century AD.  Building on advancements in neural interfaces and gene therapy, cybernetics enabled the construction of vastly complex machines that employed advanced feedback systems to perform a variety of functions.  Limb replacements and body enhancements became available, as well as powerful warfare applications that combined the power of cybernetics and neural interface technology to create vehicles that could learn and respond based on an individual pilot's style.  The War Walker was a prime example of this technology at work.

[ADVANCE_DEMOCRACY_HISTORICAL]
Throughout history, democracy (from the Greek words demos, meaning "people," and kratos, meaning "rule") took three basic forms:  a) direct democracy, in which the right to engage in the political process was able to be exercised by citizens as a whole, acting under procedures of majority rule; b) representative democracy, in which citizens exercised the same right through representatives chosen by and accountable to them; c) constitutional democracy, a form of representative democracy in which the powers of the majority were exercised within a structure of constitutional restraints designed to insure all citizens' enjoyment of individual and collective rights.

Democracy was born in ancient Greek city-states where the whole body of citizens acted as a legislature.  This system was possible because populations of these city-states rarely exceeded 10,000 people and women and slaves had no political rights.  Executive and judicial offices were filled by popular election or lottery assignment.  There was no separation of executive, legislative and judicial powers.  Despite these early beginnings, modern democracies did not take their cues from the brief period of Greek democracy.  Age of Enlightenment-era thinkers began to infatuate themselves with the classical concepts of democracy and the republic.  In 1789, the United States Congress enacted one of the most successful constitutional democracies in history with the ratifying of the U.S. Constitution.  Representative democracy continued to garner adherents throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, making it one of the most successful political concepts of the modern age.

[ADVANCE_DIGITAL_ENCRYPTION_HISTORICAL]
Manual encryption, the process of disguising information or data to render it unintelligible to an unauthorized person, was used as early as Roman times.  With the explosion of computing technology in the mid-20th century, cryptologists began to develop exponentially more sophisticated digital encryption schemes to encode sensitive communications during World War II.  Computers encrypted data by applying an algorithm - a set of procedures or instructions for performing a specified task - to a section of data.  The transmitter of the message and the intended recipient only knows the encryption key.  In this way, any intercepted communications or unauthorized access merely uncovers useless strings of data.

In the late 1970s, there were two encryption types:  symmetric encryption, which required the same key for both encryption and decryption, and asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, which required a different key for both encryption and decryption.  Asymmetric encryption enables the transfer of disguised data between allied parties at separate locations without having to transfer the unencrypted key.  The chief advantage of these more complex encryption schemes was their impregnability.  Even with a computer attempting 10,000 keys per second, a 10-character key derived from the 256 standard ASCII characters would take about 40 billion centuries to complete.

However, as the power and speed of microprocessors increased in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, previously impregnable encryption schemes were being cracked with the brute force assistance of raw processor power.  Businesses and government entities sunk millions of dollars into cryptography schemes that could guarantee the security of sensitive information over the Internet, such as financial transactions, medical records and government documents.  With the creation of the first data haven, the world had its first truly secure information facility.  Employing state-of-the-art asymmetric encryption schemes with superior physically secure server facilities, any kind of data or transaction could find a home far from the threat of government snoops, crackers or law enforcement.

[ADVANCE_DRAMA_HISTORICAL]
Drama and theater derives from the oral tradition of storytelling, where people told myths, history and instructional stories to younger generations to educate, enlighten and entertain.  The history of drama is as diverse as the myriad cultures of the world.  Greek theater consisted of masked actors speaking their lines on a stage, and was the basis for dramatic productions across the Western world.  Asian theater, by contrast, employed storytelling, dance, music and mime, and incorporated masks, makeup, scenery, costumes, puppets and props.  The focus was generally on the performance itself, whereas in Greek theater it was on the text.

Drama has had many functions:  entertainment, reinforcement of cultural or social order, religious and political education and any combination thereof.  Theaters were often the center of entertainment in a city.  Whether elaborate amphitheaters designed to seat thousands or small, wooden stages set in town squares, theaters, and theatrical performances have been a main source of entertainment in the vast majority of cultures.

The Ramayana was one of the two great classic Sanskrit epic poems of India.  Based on numerous legends, it was probably composed in the third century BC by the great Hindu poet Valmiki.  Although initially a poem, it was also performed as a dramatic work in many Southeast Asian cultures and influenced Asian and Indian culture, art and theater for millennia.

Before then, mercantilism and physiocracy were the competing schools of thought concerning economic policy.  Economists were primarily concerned with the production, distribution, exchange and consumption of goods and services.  They studied the ways in which individuals, institutions and enterprises sought their economic objectives.  A study of economics was augmented by insight into psychology, ethics, history and sociology.  With these other fields, one could explain how objectives were formed, how they changed and how humans behaved in the pursuit of them.

Ancient thinkers considered commerce an inferior pursuit to agriculture.  This prejudice can be found expressed in the writings of the Greeks Plato and Aristotle, as well as the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church, which condemned usury (the taking of interest for money loaned).  Nevertheless, as Western Europe pulled farther away from agrarian economies throughout the Industrial Revolution, commerce, and the study of economics became a vital pursuit.  In modern times, it became difficult to separate the worlds of politics and economics, so intertwined were their objectives, motives and methods.

[ADVANCE_ECOTOPIA_HISTORICAL]
The state of the world's ecology in the 22nd century was reaching crisis levels.  Beginning with the rise of the factory during the Industrial Revolution of 18th and 19th century Europe, the impact of human existence on other forms of life began to dramatically increase.  Despite conservation movements and the development of nuclear power, fuel cells and fusion power over the next three centuries, the environment was still in danger.  Species populations were in decline around the world, global warming had rendered coastal cities uninhabitable and the toxicity of the soil and water was mutating indigenous plants and animals.  A new philosophy of radical environmentalism, comprised of a way of life that was most in harmony with nature, emerged as a full-fledged political movement in the early 22nd century.  The Ecotopians sought not only to repair the damage wrought by centuries of unchecked progress but also to design a system of living that guaranteed the health of the planet by minimizing the human impact on ecologies.

Ecotopians advocated the elimination, by any means available, of any systems that generated pollution.  Ecotopian strike forces raided cities, detonating nanite bombs designed to take out antiquated fossil-fuel-burning power plants.  Though their methods were controversial, they won many passionate adherents and eventually began gaining political power in some of the major industrialized nations.  Perhaps the most sublimely ironic aspect of the ecotopian philosophy was their reliance on the most recent technology - nanotechnology - to advance their agenda.  Unabated technological process was the prime contributor to the world ecological crisis, and ecotopians sought to reverse the deleterious effects with technology itself.

The ancient Greeks were the first to study an electrical phenomenon in the form of static electricity.  They discovered that, when rubbed with fur, amber stones attracted light objects such as feathers.  The word electric comes from the Greek word "elektron," meaning amber.  At the end of the 16th century, British physician William Gilbert investigated the relationship of static electricity and magnetism.  American inventor and statesman Benjamin Franklin famously proved the electrical nature of lightning in his famous kite experiment of 1752 and he established the convention of using negative and positive to indicate different kinds of charge.  By the mid-18th century, electrical materials were divided into two major categories:  insulators, which, when rubbed, would get and keep a static surface electric charge, and conductors, mostly metals, which were able to carry away the charge from the insulator.  It was also discovered that conductors could store a charge if they were insulated from their surroundings.  These discoveries gave rise to the use of electric generators as a power source.  The harnessing and implementation of electricity was one of the chief advancements of the modern age.

Although black powder was though to have originated in China, other evidence indicated that the Arabs were the first to develop it.  By 1304, the Arabs had invented the first firearm, a bamboo tube reinforced with iron that shot an arrow with a charge of black powder.  Although the Europeans adopted black powder for firearms use in the 14th and 15th centuries, it was not until the late 17th century that black powder was employed for use in explosives.  Comprised of the solid ingredients saltpeter (potassium nitrate), charcoal and sulfur, it was first adapted for industrial use to blast out mines.  

In 1846, Ascanio Sobrero, an Italian chemist, discovered nitroglycerin, and soon after, nitroglycerin and dynamite replaced black powder as the primary explosive.  In 1867, the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel invented dynamite from a mixture of 75 percent nitroglycerin and 25 percent guhr (a porous, absorbent material that improved control and ease of use).  Later, ammonium nitrate was used in dynamite, making it even safer and less expensive to produce.

[END]

[ADVANCE_FASCISM_HISTORICAL]
Fascism was one of the most controversial and oppressive forms of government ever conceived.  It was borne out of the disillusionment with the ineffectual government, chaotic economy and lack of leadership in post-World War I Italy.  These conditions provided the perfect atmosphere for the glorification of militaristic, authoritarian ideals.  In 1919, Benito Mussolini founded the fascist movement in Milan, Italy.  On October 28, 1922, Mussolini, accompanied by his black-shirted followers, staged a march on Rome, demanding that he be appointed prime minister and threatening to take over the government by force if he was refused.  The king caved to his demands, inviting Mussolini to form a government.  An assault on leftist political forces soon followed as groups of armed fascists stormed the headquarters of leftist parties, assaulting and even murdering their membership.  The following January, Mussolini outlawed all political parties but the Fascist party, rendering Italy a totalitarian state.

The principle fascist regimes of the 20th century, in Italy from 1922-43, Germany from 1933-45 and Spain during 1939-75, were intensely nationalistic, violent, oppressive nations defined by a few distinct characteristics.  The absolute primacy of the state, the submission of the individual will to the unified will of the state and the total obedience to a single leader, who embodies the state.  The virtues of combat, conquest and the military are held in high esteem, while liberal democracy, rationalism and bourgeois values are violently denigrated.  Fascist leaders often infused their rule with an element of mysticism, expressing the sanctity of the state and even invoking folk heroes and popular music to foment a sanctimonious and fanatical dedication from adherents.  The word fascism is derived from the Italian word "fascismo," itself derived from the Latin word "fasces," a bundle of wooden rods wrapped around an axe.  The fasces were symbols of authority in ancient Rome, and Mussolini adopted it as an emblem of his movement in 1919, heralding the rebirth of the Roman Empire.

[ADVANCE_FEUDALISM_HISTORICAL]
Feudalism is a social system based on land ownership, in which vassals held land in fief from lords to whom they were obliged, by personal relationship or service.  What also distinguished feudalism was that those who performed official duties, whether civil or military, did not do it for the state or for public service.  Rather, they fulfilled them in service of personal relationships with landowners in exchange for fiefs, hereditarily held estates from which they could make money.  This decentralized public authority, and the manorial system, in which peasants served landlords with few rights or freedoms, gave lords wide-ranging power over the fiscal, judicial and constabulary systems.

Feudalism flourished in societies with closed agricultural economies, particularly in Western Europe during the High Middle Ages, in Japan from the 12th to the 19th century and in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem from 1099 until 1291.  War was common in feudal periods.  The Sengoku period of Japanese history marked a nearly hundred-year-long conflict between rival daimyo (Japanese, "great holders of private land") who continually fought each other for power following the collapse of central authority in the 15th century.  As samurai served daimyo in feudal Japan, knights served lords in feudal Western Europe.  They were the warrior class, many of them vassals who enjoyed tremendous respect and power.

Although research into nuclear fusion began in the 1950s, it was not until the end of the 20th century that scientists began to have success with creating fusion reactors.  Whereas nuclear fission reactions occur when particles split atoms, fusion reactions occur when two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier element.  The nuclei must be moving at high speed in order to overcome their mutual electrical repulsion.  When these nuclei fuse, a small amount of mass is converted into a large amount of energy.  Late 20th century designs of fusion reactors relied on extremely hot, dense plasma, i.e. an ionized gas consisting of free nuclei and free electrons, used to impart the high speeds of the nuclei.  Deuterium and tritium nuclei, the easiest nuclei to fuse, provided the fuel for the reactor.

[ADVANCE_GAIA_CONTROLLER_HISTORICAL]
The Gaia Controller was the greatest scientific achievement of the 23rd century.  Its development was borne out of research into Gaia theory, which employed nanotechnology to dramatically reduce pollution.  However, Gaia-theory-based applications for pollution reduction had a range limited to a few hundred miles.  Scientists began to envision a global pollution reduction system.  One possible solution, proposed by noted scientist David White, was to create a system that converted the actual matter that comprised pollution into energy.  It would simultaneously clean up the environment and provide an energy source.

The Solaris Project was the experiment that proved that safe conversion from matter to energy was possible.  A highly secretive endeavor, its primary research took place on a satellite laboratory.  By sending a probe into the center of the sun, Solaris Project scientists were able to unlock the secrets of converting matter into energy back into matter.  Soon after this discovery, they began construction on the Gaia Controller, a global matter converter that would provide limitless non-polluting energy.

The Gaia Controller was comprised of three distinct groups of componentry.  A system of small satellites circled the planet, collecting space debris, solar energy and various other sources of matter.  Once collected the satellites converted the matter to energy, periodically beaming it down to obelisks placed at regular intervals on the surface.  The obelisks were the primary matter collecting entities in the system, sending out vast groups of nanites designed to hunt out polluting agents in the air, water and earth.  They also acted as receptacles for energy collected from satellites.  Obelisks distributed energy to the various Gaia controller cores in cities around the world.  The controller cores enabled operators to oversee the system, distribute and control energy and provide cities with a limitless supply of energy for the creation of new matter.

Gaia theory developed out of the same environmental preservation philosophy that spawned the ecotopian movement.  With the discovery of nano-machines, the world was finally capable of implementing nanotechnology on a grand scale.  Whereas nano-assembly enabled the construction of objects in nanite factories, nano-machines enabled the creation of sub-microscopic machines that could perform nearly any function.  With this new technology, ecotopians conceived of a radical new approach to repairing the ecological damage wrought at the hands of post-modern human existence.  Utilizing nanites designed to seek out any man-industrial by-products such as toxic waste and non-naturally occurring chemicals, they could return an ecologically devastated area to "what nature had intended."  

Although this technology was originally intended for environmental cleanup, it was soon adapted by extreme factions of ecotopian terrorists who sought to condemn any nation that produces more than trace amounts of pollution.  Their ultimate creation, the Eco-Ranger was designed as the ultimate nanite cleansing device.  Armed with nanites designed to destroy any non-natural by-product, building or object, it utterly eradicates any trace of humanity within the range of the blast.  The notion of "what nature had intended" had been taken to a violent, abominable extreme, and the new technology threatened to undo six millennia worth of human progress.

Gene Therapy was one of the most revolutionary and amazing applications of genetics in the history of mankind.  It involved inserting or sometimes deleting portions of genes in diseased patients, curing their ailments and enabling them to live healthier lives.  Initial forays into gene therapy in the late 20th century focused on eliminating relatively simple genetic disorders, such as sickle-cell anemia, that are caused by a single defective gene.  But soon, scientists learned that, by adding genes to cells gave them new functions and led to the treatment of more serious, genetically complicated disorders like hereditary heart disease and cancer.

In the mid-21st century, geneticists began to experiment with other applications of gene therapy.  Now that they could eradicate hereditary disease and defects, they concentrated their efforts on enhancing human intellectual and emotional capacities.  Their research led to the development of methods to genetically predispose human beings to be brilliant, emotionally responsive geniuses.  Empaths began to find a role in business and government as superbly skilled diplomats.  On October 24, 2095, 150 years to the day after the establishment of the United Nations, an international organization of Empathic Diplomats created the World Peace Center, dedicated to the preservation of peace and the pursuit of global harmony.

Building on the monumental discoveries in the field of genetics over the first half of the 21st century, geneticists began to explore the world of gene synthesis and customization.  Genetics enabled them to create life by copying existing genes, and gene therapy enabled them to alter existing genes and splice them into existing DNA.  Genetic tailoring, pioneered by the Anthony D. Evans Genetics Research Laboratory, was a process by which geneticists fabricated genes from scratch, imbuing them with the code to produce specific attributes.

The first completely synthesized living organism was a butterfly with luminescent wings and a genetically programmed ability to respond to the human voice.  Later, scientists began to create animals with built-in resistances to pesticides and toxins.  The ultimate expression of genetic tailoring came when commercial ventures enabled people to design and customize their offspring.  They could combine their own genetic material with tailored genes, or leave their DNA out of the process completely.  Human beings now had the power to truly create any kind of life.

[ADVANCE_GLOBAL_DEFENSE_HISTORICAL]
The second half of the twentieth century saw an escalation of tension between the Soviet Union and the United States.  Although they had been allies in World War II, ideological differences cooled relations between the two nations.  As each raced to mount ever greater military arsenals with which to stare each other down, and as access to each others' countries was difficult to obtain, a silent, covert war of espionage played out over the course of the 4 decades following the end of World War II.

In order to counter the growing threat of losing technology and secrets to each other, both nations bolstered their espionage efforts, expanding agencies whose sole purpose was the gathering of military intelligence.  Although these organizations existed before the cold war, they began to play a crucial role in the politics of the world.

[END]

[ADVANCE_GLOBAL_ECONOMICS_HISTORICAL]
The Globalization of the world economy in the late 20th and early 21st century was a mixed blessing.  Corporations in Europe and the United States had an opportunity to tap emerging markets in China, India, Latin America and Eastern Europe.  They also sought to move their production operations to wherever they could find the least expensive labor pool and minimal of environmental regulations.  This usually meant moving production operations to third-world and developing countries while keeping most management, marketing, and finance divisions in their home countries.  Although the developing nations benefited from the availability of jobs, they overwhelmingly demanded unskilled, repetitive work for minimal wages and long hours.  Multinational corporations were able to increase profits, but often at the expense of human rights and the environment.  Moreover, as these Western businesses took their profits home, the disparity between first and third world nations grew.  The economies of Western Europe and the U.S. began to soar as other nations, now indebted to multinationals for job security and economic sustenance, descended even deeper into poverty.

The spread of global capitalism demanded a vast transport system to shuttle goods, from raw materials to consumer products, around the globe.  Worldwide shipping, cargo planes and rail systems comprised a huge freight transport system that fed the world economy.  One of the most popular consumer products was motion pictures.  Although many nations had their own film industries, Hollywood and the greater Los Angeles area was home to the largest and most successful conglomeration of movie studios in the world.  By distributing its products around the world, the motion picture studios create a powerful global enterprise.

Completed in 1866, the Atlantic telegraph cable opened trans-oceanic telecommunications.  However, the Atlantic cable was but the first of a growing communication network.  Telephone lines soon followed, with major telecommunications corporations investing billions of dollars over the course of the 20th century upgrading existing lines and laying new ones.  In 1974, the first commercial satellite flew into orbit, and by the early 21st century, a combination of fiber optic land lines and rings of orbital digital satellites had linked the world.  With the rise of satellite telephone service, even the remotest regions of the planet were within reach.  The global satellite network enabled the military to monitor the world through spy satellites equipped with high-powered cameras.  The nation who possessed this technology could watch any activity around the world and monitor their rivals with unprecedented access.

[ADVANCE_GUNPOWDER_HISTORICAL]
Although black powder, also known as gunpowder, was thought to have originated in China, other evidence indicated that the Arabs were the first to develop it.  By 1304, the Arabs had invented the first firearm, a bamboo tube reinforced with iron that shot an arrow with a charge of gunpowder.  The Europeans adopted black powder for firearms use in the 14th and 15th centuries.  It was not until the late 17th century that gunpowder was employed for use in explosives for peacetime applications, such as mining and road building, as well as war.

Black powder is comprised of the solid ingredients saltpeter (potassium nitrate), charcoal and sulfur.  In the early days, manufacturers simply ground the ingredients together by hand with a mortar and pestle.  In the 15th century, wooden stamps connected to water-driven mills could grind larger quantities faster.  Power-driven metallic devices replaced these in the 19th century.

It is unknown when horses were first domesticated, but it is almost certainly after the domestication of dogs or of cattle.  Historians have speculated that a tribe of Indo-European origin living in the steppes of central Asia may have been the first to use horses for more than just food.

Humans used horses for a variety of purposes.  More than any other animal, the horse has had a unique, almost partner-oriented relationship with the humans it serves.  It was used to plow fields and bring in the harvest, transport goods and carry passengers.  It followed game and helped track cattle, and, most importantly, carried humans into battle and brought intrepid adventurers to far-off lands.  Humans used horses for recreation and sport, in the form of jousting, carousels and the sport of riding.

[END]

[ADVANCE_HT_SUPERCONDUCTOR_HISTORICAL]
Since the discovery of superconducting materials, scientists have searched for superconductors that could operate at normal, naturally occurring temperatures.  Many early superconductors were sensitive to such things as oxygen content and humidity and, perhaps most limiting, require extremely low temperatures to operate.  Their lack of resistance made superconductors ideal for electromagnets that generated large magnetic fields with no energy loss.  They were used primarily in medical diagnosis, materials science and particle accelerators.

In the mid-21st century, scientists developed highly synthesized ceramic compounds that could maintain superconductivity at room temperature.  Coupled with their tolerance for all but the most severe atmospheric conditions, these new high temperature superconductors had a much greater range of applications than previous superconductors did.  High temperature superconductors revolutionized Magnetic Levitation Train (Maglev) technology and enabled engineers to develop high-speed maglevs capable of speeds in excess of 300 mph.

Scientific research also benefited from high temperature superconductors.  The Field Dynamics Laboratory employed high temperature superconductors in diagnostic machines and monitoring instruments, enabling scientists to measure the results of experiments with unprecedented sensitivity.

Although skin boats, like the coracle, were widely used in the calm and shallow waters around the world, they had little impact on the development of wooden-hulled ships.  The dugout boat, a long, slender boat carved out of the trunk of a massive tree was developed from 300 BC on.  The Viking longship was one of the first seafaring vessels that employed a clinker-built hull with overlapping planks of wood.  A single square sail and oarsmen propelled it, and it performed exceptionally in heavy seas.  Ranging from 45 to 75 feet in length, it was a main component of Viking pirate raids in the 9th century and even brought Leif Eriksson to America in 1000 AD.  Although the Dutch, French, English and Germans also employed the longship in war and in trade, only the Vikings managed to venture across the Atlantic Ocean.

Although many people had ethical, religious and philosophical concerns about the implications of human cloning, the temptation to crack the genetic code and experiment with the replication of human life was too great to resist.  Long after the success of the Genome Project, geneticists set about exploring ways in which human genetic material could be created.  In the late 21st century, they succeeded in synthesizing a human kidney, which was successfully implanted into a subject.  On February 10, 2098, the first human clone was born in the Center for Genetic Creation in Santa Monica, California.  Using a prototypical incubation machine, geneticists at the CGC were able to provide a perfect environment for cell replication and fetal nurturing.  In the coming years, incubation centers sprang up across the world, making available the opportunity to have a child without in utero gestation.

[ADVANCE_INDUSTRIAL_REVOLUTION_HISTORICAL]
The English economic historian Arnold Toynbee (1852-83) was the first to popularize the term Industrial Revolution, using it to describe England's economic development from 1760 to 1840.  Since his time, other historians have more broadly applied the term to any society that changed from an agrarian, artisan economy to one in which industry and machine manufacturing prevailed.  The primary changes of the Industrial Revolution were technological, socioeconomic and cultural.

Technological changes included use of new materials, such as iron and steel, and the use of new energy sources, including coal, the steam engine, electricity and the petroleum-based internal combustion engine.  In addition, new machines, such as the spinning jenny and the power loom vastly increased the production of materials with a minimum of human energy.  The factory system further divided labor and increased specialization of function.  The application of science to industry also marked one major change, making possible a vastly increased use of natural resources and the mass production of manufactured goods.  The technological advancements of the Industrial Revolution made important developments in transportation and communication, including steam-powered ships and locomotives, automobiles, airplanes, telegraphs and radio, possible.

Socioeconomic and cultural changes manifest in larger, more populous cities, an explosion in the size of the working class, and a wider redistribution of wealth.  Land as a source of wealth diminished in relevance as rising industrial production and international trade placed greater value in having control over the means of production and distribution of goods.  Although workers were overwhelmingly poor and disenfranchised, a new commerce-fueled middle class emerged as a political and social force.  New state policies reflected the needs of the shifting industrial society.  Perhaps the most important shift in culture came from the redefinition of the role of the worker.  No longer craftsmen working with tools, workers were now machine operators, subject to factory discipline.  Working class political movements began to call into question the devaluation of an individual's worth and skill at the hands of a new production paradigm that sought to minimize human involvement.  Despite sizeable leaps in the efficiency and productive capacity of industry and commerce, the new industrial culture valued prosperity and progress over the needs of common people, a cultural conflict that continued to play out for centuries.

[ADVANCE_INTERNAL_COMBUSTION_HISTORICAL]
The internal combustion engine emerged in the 19th century as a substitute for steam power.  Cannon provided inspiration, and early efforts involved igniting gunpowder in a cylinder to power a piston.  Finding a suitable fuel was the greatest problem, as was finding a way to ignite it in a closed space to produce an action that could be easily and quickly repeated.  The addition of gas solved only the first problem, until Étienne Lenoir built the first successful gas engine in Paris in 1859.  It used gas and air ignited by electric sparks to power a single piston.  In 1878, German Inventor Nikolaus Otto refined the internal combustion engine by introducing the four-stroke cycle of induction-compression-ignition-exhaust that has been known by his name ever since.  Small industrial operations opted for the gas engine as a source of power, as it was a cheaper and less maintenance-intensive than boiler rooms.

The internal combustion engine was an ideal power source for vehicles as well.  Small ships, like the troop ship, no longer had to rely on steam power, and used gas engines quite frequently.

[ADVANCE_JET_PROPULSION_HISTORICAL]
In 1930, British aeronautical engineer Sir Frank Whittle was awarded a patent for a gas turbine engine.  Although others had developed similar engines, his design became the first practical application of modern jet propulsion technology.  In 1935, he applied his design to the development of the W-1 turbojet engine, which made its first flight in 1941.  Over the next five decades, jet propulsion technology continued to advance.  Late in World War II, the first jet-powered fighters entered service.  The first commercial jet airplane, the British Comet, flew in 1952 but stopped service after two serious accidents in 1954.  The Boeing 707 was the first U.S. commercial jet airplane tested and it began commercial service in 1958.

Jet propulsion technology revolutionized aeronautics, rocketry and space flight.  Continued developments resulted in piloted aircraft reaching speeds several times greater than the speed of sound.  Intercontinental ballistic missiles rely on jet technology to propel them, as do satellites rely on powerful rockets to send them into space.

The extremely hostile environment of the deepest oceans had prevented manned exploration of the ocean floor for much of the 20th century.  As fluid breathing systems became available, the worst problem, that of human reliance on properly pressurized oxygen to breathe, was finally dealt with.  Research into the differences between human lungs and fish gills revealed structural, but not compositional, differences in the oxygen membrane of each.  In other words, they were fundamentally the same material, although their uses differed slightly.  Filling lungs with an oxygen-infused fluorocarbon emulsion was the answer, enabling the lungs to derive oxygen and sustain the function.  Combined with a deep-water suit to protect the body against cold and pressure, the fluid breathing system opened up the world of submarine canyons, trenches and ocean floors to manned research craft.  Military applications prevailed with the development of the scout submarine.

Some societies, such as the Egyptians, standardized masonry techniques as early as 4000 BC.  Masonry is divided into two broad categories called rubble and ashlar.  Rubble involves irregular and coarsely jointed quarried and field stones.  Ashlar, by contrast, is made up of cut stones set with fine, close joints.  Some cultures opted to use mortar and other adhesives, but others used "dry masonry."

The limitations of geography and whatever geological conditions prevailed have affected access to masonry materials.  Sandstone, limestone, alabaster, granite and basalt dominate Egyptian architecture as sun-dried and kiln-glazed clay bricks are found in Persian and Assyrian structures.  Masonry became a crucial skill for ancient peoples, and its mastery has enabled civilizations to solve many problems of resource access, national security and city expansion.

The Romans made extensive use of masonry, adapting their methods to the idiosyncrasies of each geographic area they ruled.  Perhaps the most famous Roman masonry achievement was their aqueduct system.  Stretching for hundreds of miles, from Gaul to Asia Minor, aqueducts provided Roman citizens and subjects with fresh water for public baths, toilets, and fountains.

Built in the 3rd century BC, the Great Wall of China is one of the wonders of the world.  Winding along 1,500 miles of Northern China from the Gansu province to the Hebei province, it was designed to protect China from northern nomads and invaders.  Almost all of it is earth and stone faced with brick, an example of the permanency and durability of masonry.

Although radio was a primary source of news and entertainment for much of the civilized world, the television became the overwhelmingly dominant medium in the late 20th century.  The first two decades of the 20th century saw developments in picture tube technology, methods of amplifying electronic signals and the theoretical formulation of the electronic-scanning principle.  These advancements later became the basis of the modern television.  In 1932, the Radio Corporation of America employed a camera tube called an iconoscope and a cathode-ray tube in the receiver of one of the first all-electronic televisions.  By the 1950s, there were separate color and black-and-white signals broadcast.  Televisions became a standard fixture in the living rooms of America, supplanting radio as the dominant source of entertainment.  By the 1960s, television had reached many other nations and, by the end of the 20th century had impacted virtually every aspect of the societies in which it was used, from politics and culture to art and entertainment.

[ADVANCE_MASS_PRODUCTION_HISTORICAL]
The Industrial Revolution ushered in the age of factory-driven production, with huge machines increase automation and virtually eliminating the need for highly skilled artisans and craftsmen.  Factory systems continued to evolve throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and, in 1913, a moving conveyor belt installed in an automobile plant in Dearborn, Michigan became the first instance of modern mass production techniques in use.  One of the progenitors of mass production was industrialist and inventor Henry Ford.  He and his colleagues examined the historical benefits of dividing the manufacturing process into sequences of individual tasks, each performed by a specially trained worker.  Ford further refined his conveyor belt operations by employing the time and motion studies pioneered by F.W. Taylor and Lillian B. Gilbreth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Mass production techniques took the manufacturing world by storm.  Specialization, division of labor and standardization of parts lowered the cost, improved the quality and increased the quantity of finished goods.  These changes particularly affected large-scale manufacturing operations, such as automobile, ship and airplane building.

[ADVANCE_MASS_TRANSIT_HISTORICAL]
Mass Transit is designed to move large numbers of people in and around cities, suburbs and large metropolitan areas.  As modern urban planning efforts began to separate urban areas into industrial, commercial and residential areas, planners developed complex public transit systems to enable people to cheaply and efficiently move between their homes and workplaces.

Originally private owned and operated, mass transit systems became more complex and expensive to operate, prompting many city and county governments to take over.  There are two basic kinds of mass transit: fixed- and nonfixed-route.  Fixed-route usually involves rail and trolley systems in below surface, surface and above-surface modes.  Nonfixed-route refers to travel on streets and highways.  Some systems utilize ferries, boats, hydroplanes and even hovercrafts where geography and commuter need demands it.

New methods of microscopy enabled doctors to know almost the entire structure of the human body by the beginning of the 19th century.  Doctors, particularly in Germany, began to make considerably headway into the understanding of physiological processes. Under the guidance of Johannes Müller, a professor at Bonn and the University of Berlin, Germany established physiology as a distinct science.  He detailed his discoveries in his famous textbook, Handbuch der Physiologie des Menschen ("Manual of Human Physiology"), published in the 1830s.

Medicine developed further throughout the 1800s, as science and technology augmented medicine's efforts to uncover the mysteries of the human body and its various systems.  Breakthroughs in pharmacology ushered in a new era of modern medicine in the early 1900s.

[ADVANCE_MODERN_METALLURGY_HISTORICAL]
Metallurgy is the art and science of extracting metals from their ores and modifying the metals for use.  Although it is primarily a commercial, rather than a scientific, endeavor, metallurgy is also concerned with the chemical, physical and atomic properties and structures of metals, as well as the combination of different metals to form alloys.  Simple metal working dates back to 4500 BC, in which Stone Age peoples fashioned ornamental and utilitarian items out of gold, silver and copper.  Most likely found in riverbeds, gravels and sands, these metals were in a metallic state naturally, and required little more than cleaning and hammering.  What brought humans into the Metal Age, marking the first efforts at metallurgy, was the discovery that metals, such as copper, could be melted and cast into molds.  The next step was the discovery that metals could be extracted from metal-bearing minerals.  This increased the availability of metals, and further refinement of the process signaled the start of the Metal Age.

Modern metallurgy in the early 19th century was primarily focused on iron and steel production.  Although the processes were intense and non-mechanized, the metals were in high demand.  Iron armor-encased wooden ships, called ironclads, revolutionized naval warfare and dominated seas for two decades before the advent of all-metal ships in the second half of the 19th century.  Advances in metallurgy led to the production of cheap steel and lighter, resilient metals such as aluminum.

Monarchy was a government in which the supreme authority was vested in a single person, usually a hereditary sovereign, who was the permanent head of state.  It was the basis for most medieval empires.  Monarchs provided the centralized power needed by fledgling nations in the 16th and 17th centuries.  The monarch was usually the absolute ruler, the source of law and of administration.  Feudal societies often thrived within a monarchy.  Monarchy existed in various iterations in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe.  Some monarchies lasted until well into the 20th century, although these later monarchies abandoned absolutism in favor of a parliamentary system.

Nanotechnology is the vast field of science dedicated to the study and development of objects whose size is measured in nano-meters (1 billionth of a meter and 10,000 times narrower than a human hair).  As it evolved, nanotechnology revolutionized and affected almost every field of human interest, from electronics, medicine and energy to construction and manufacturing.  The development of nanotechnology began in the late 20th century, with the building of the first nano-machines, tiny gears and motors that signaled a new, sub-microscopic scale world to come.  Although these first machines did no useful work, they laid the groundwork for developers to create practical applications of nanotechnology.

Before scientists were able to build functional nano-machines, they discovered a way to assemble simple items at the molecular level.  Nanite factories sprang up in cities, enabling manufacturers to construct objects out of minerals such as gold, carbon and titanium, as well as organic materials such as wood.  Complex objects, such as electrical appliances, could be constructed as well.  Later applications of nano-assembly allowed for the manufacture of objects of unorthodox construction, such as sheets of flawless diamond.  Nanite construction and nano-assembly revolutionized the manufacturing industry, rendering robotic plants obsolete.

As nanotechnology continued to develop in the commercial and industrial world, the military began to seek ways in which nanites could be used for both the propagation, and the prevention, of warfare.  In the late 22nd century, military-funded scientists developed nanite carriers for biological agents.  Capable of timed-release of viral and bacterial pathogens, these nanite devices could wreak havoc, infecting, disabling or even killing large groups of people.  Even more pernicious, cities without proper defense or ability to detect nanites would be powerless to determine the source of the scourge, let alone who was responsible.

The Micro Defense improvement helped solve this problem.  Using nanites to monitor the air in and around a city, the micro defense could locate and isolate both biological and nanotechnological weapons and neutralize them.  Micro Defense nanites were also specially designed to replicate themselves and evolve to combat new strains of pathogens should they be released.  With the evolution of nano-warfare, the battlefield shifted to the sub-microscopic level, bringing new potential for terrorism and destruction.

It was not long before national loyalty begat a powerful social force, becomin, in some notable instances, more important even than religious or ethnic affiliations.  In large part due to the harmful by-products of nationalism, including jingoism, bigotry, and persecution, it is often considered synonymous with extremism in modern times.

In the first decades of the 20th century, naval combat was overwhelming dominated by the battleship and battle cruiser.  All-metal ships of devastating power and range, battleships could bombard land targets from miles away.  During and after World War I, British, U.S. and Japanese navies experimented with attaching flat platforms to existing ships to provide a mobile takeoff and landing strip for planes.  By the late 1920's, the first aircraft carriers entered naval service and, in World War II, they swiftly and dramatically usurped the battleship's throne and revolutionized naval warfare for decades.

Carrier-based aircraft continued to evolve and see conflict throughout the latter half of the 20th century.  Eventually, many of the world powers decommissioned and retired their battleships from service while augmenting their navies with aircraft carriers.  The U.S. fleet of Nimitz-class carriers became the ironfisted enforcer of American foreign policy well into the 21st century.

[ADVANCE_NAVAL_TACTICS_HISTORICAL]
Ships were originally conceived as floating fortresses, and conventional military practice involved placing guns as high on the fore and aft castles as possible to maintain height advantage over enemies.  As cannon grew heavier over the years, placing them high rendered ships dangerously unstable.  Bringing cannon down from castles to mid decks and later to lower decks was a revolutionary idea.  The purpose of cannons changed from an anti-personnel weapon used to aid in boarding to one that crippled ships.  By aiming cannon at the masts and rigging, attackers could render a ship "dead in the water" and capture it with ease.

Naval tactics underwent another shift with the development of the line ahead formation for ships.  A fleet of ships, all of similar strength, sailed in the wake of the ships ahead of them, forming a "ribbon of death" miles long but scarcely 300 yards wide.  This enabled each ship to have a clear shot at the enemy as no friendly ships ever risked sailing in front of their powerful broadside-mounted guns.  The term ship of the line originated in the 1700s to describe the only suitable ships "to lie in the line of battle."

As the use of line ahead tactics increased, shipbuilders began rolling out ships with greater capacity.  First-rate ships of the line carried as many as 136 cannon on three separate gun decks.  These huge ships were less common, however, than third-raters, 175-footers with two full gun decks of as much as 74 cannon.  These faster and more maneuverable ships dominated the seas until the late 19th century development of the battleship.

The genetics research of the early 21st century unconcealed many of the mysteries surrounding the human central nervous system.  Although doctors and scientists were well aware of its electrical nature, they could only speculate on the way in which they could enable the nervous system to intelligently interact with other electrical systems.

In 2016, the genetics research firm, Intrinsic Systems, headed by artificial intelligence expert and geneticist Richard Myers, created the first functional prototype for a neural interface.  The test subjects were able to manipulate a pointer device on a computer screen by thinking of where they wanted it to go.  The neural interface interpreted the electrochemical impulses in their brains and translated them into commands the computer could understand.  

This technological breakthrough garnered Myers widespread acclaim, and enabled him to secure funding for a more ambitious interface device.  Within two years, the first commercial neural interface devices hit the market.  Although these devices were designed to be worn or attached to the head, by 2019 the military had developed a highly classified, internal neural interface that enabled faster and more sophisticated neural manipulation of complex systems.

[ADVANCE_NUCLEAR_POWER_HISTORICAL]
In 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission.  By bombarding uranium with neutrons in an attempt to create elements heavier than uranium, they unwittingly induced a fission reaction.  When a particle such as a neuron hits the nucleus of a uranium atom, it causes it to split into two fission fragments of roughly the same atomic composition.  This process releases a large amount of thermal energy, as well as gamma rays and a few free neutrons, which in turn fission other uranium nuclei.  This series of fissions constitutes a chain reaction, which yields a constant supply of nuclear energy.  If these reactions could be controlled, scientists theorized, then one would have a supply of energy much cleaner than conventional oil, gas and coal-burning power plants.  In the late 1950s an early '60s, a few commercial nuclear power plants were built.  The most successful of these used water as a cooling system for reactors.  The demand for nuclear plants skyrocketed in the mid-1960s and early '70s but dropped off in the later part of the decade, due to a decline in need, coupled with public fears about the danger of nuclear meltdown.

In 1954, the first nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus, was commissioned.  Powered by a small amount of enriched uranium, the small reactor needed no oxygen at all, allowing the Nautilus to travel submerged for extended periods with no need to surface.  Nuclear power made larger, more powerful and more effective submarines available, forever changing the nature of naval combat in the second half of the 20th century.

Nuclear weapons were developed even earlier than power plants.  Conventional cruise missiles could be outfitted with a nuclear warhead that, when detonated would spark a plutonium fission reaction.  The U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with two uranium fission bombs, was a horrifying demonstration of the military applications of nuclear fission.

[ADVANCE_OCEAN_FARING_HISTORICAL]
For centuries after the introduction of clinker-built, single-mast, square-rigged longship, European shipbuilding deviated little from this solid, seaworthy design.  Ship design underwent a major change in about 1200 AD with the introduction of the stern rudder.  Along with the deep-draft hull, the bowsprit and, eventually, additional masts, this change transformed longships into true sailing vessels, capable of beating into the wind as well as sailing with it.

Until the 15th century, European ships most likely remained single-mast, although a two-mast ship carrying lateen sails could be found in the Mediterranean.  Later clinker-built ships, most notable Henry V of England's Grâce Dieu, reflected the longship construction, but had a keel to beam ration of 2.5:1 and a second mast.  The rest of the 15th century saw a dramatic increase in the size, length and weight of ships.   The carrack was the culmination of these changes:  they weighed from 700 to 1000 tons, carried three masts and an abundance of sails, employed a carvel-built hull and carried cannon and guns below decks.  The carrack was also an ideal transport and cargo vessel.  Its high sides made it easily defensible, it had considerable larger cargo holds than previous ships, and its three masts of sails gave it the force it needed to carry heavy loads on intercontinental voyages.  The expansion of cargo capacity in the late 15th and early 16th centuries was a direct response to the explosion of trade within Europe and across the world.  International trading conglomerates could now rely on larger, more sea-worthy ships to withstand the treacherous high seas and deliver their cargo.

[ADVANCE_OIL_REFINING_HISTORICAL]
One of the most basic methods for refining crude oil was distillation.  Oil heated in kettles began to vaporize at temperatures slightly below the boiling point of water.  Because the different hydrocarbons vaporized at varying temperature levels, the distillation process yielded several useful products in succession as temperatures rose.  Gasoline was the first to be distilled, followed by naphtha and then by kerosene.  Old still refineries would then apply acids to the residues in the kettle and steam distill even more products, including lubricants, distillate fuel oils from the upper regions and waxes and asphalt from the lower regions of the apparatus.

In the late 19th century, there was little need for gasoline or naphtha, and the growing use of electricity and electric lights sent demand for kerosene down.  These parts of the distillation process were considered an annoyance, until the development of the internal combustion engine led to an explosion in demand for gasoline.  The increasing prevalence of the internal combustion engine in the modern age kept the need for crude oil, and its many distillates, growing exponentially throughout the 20th century.

By arranging lenses of various sizes and intensities in a tube, Galileo created an instrument that could display distant objects as if they were close by.  His inventions won him acclaim and paved the way to a greater understanding of celestial bodies.  Many later scientists, including Pierre de Fermat, Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton continued work in the field of optics, eventually developing complex theories on the nature of light.

[ADVANCE_PHARMACEUTICALS_HISTORICAL]
Although medicine and the creation of curatives were a well-established practice throughout ancient and renaissance times, the founding of the Society of Apothecaries, London, in 1617 marked the emergence of pharmacy as a distinct profession.  King James I authorized the separation of apothecaries from grocers, and, from then on, only member of the society could make or sell pharmaceuticals or keep an apothecary's shop.  This event was one of the many improvements in pharmaceutical practice throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.

In 1546, the first pharmacopoeia (a list of drugs and medicinal chemicals with directions for preparing them) appeared in Nuremberg, Germany.  Before this, the preparation of medicines varied in ingredients, concentration and method.  Other pharmacopoeias appeared in Basel (1561), Augsburg (1564) and London (1618), the London pharmacopoeia being the first national pharmacopoeia, adopted by all of England.

In 1841, the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, was founded, with an intent to give pharmacists in a thoroughly scientific basis.  From this point on, pharmacology was considered a scientific pursuit.  Pharmacists throughout the subsequent modern era became subject to the same government and peer reviews as medical doctors.  The rigidity of scientific processes led to advances in pharmacology that, along with new discoveries of drugs like Penicillin, made better, more consistent and more effective drugs available to the public.

Throughout world history, the term "philosophy" (from the Greek word philosophia, "love of wisdom") has meant many different things.  It encompassed the pursuit of wisdom, the understanding of the universe as a whole, the examination of morals, values and ethics, and the attempt to promote rationality and clear thinking through the codification of rules governing human thought.  At its core, philosophy was an analysis of the basis for fundamental beliefs and an examination of the expression of such beliefs.  Its pursuit was the mark of an intellectually robust civilization.  It was a reflective pursuit, with no explicitly defined subject matter.  Much like science, it was a mental operation that could be exercised on any area or subject.  Because of this flexibility, philosophy, and its subcategories ethics, logic and metaphysics, formed the basis of rational thought processes that spawned many of the scientific and cultural advances in history.

The epochal book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687; Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) was the culmination of Sir Isaac Newton's scientific work, and represented a landmark in the scientific revolution of the late 17th century.  It solved the major problems in mechanics and in cosmology that many had grappled with.  It provided a physical basis for Kepler's laws and asserted one set of laws for both celestial and terrestrial physics.  Newton introduced the concept of force, and, through the establishment of his three laws of motion, was able to explain mechanical philosophy and the mathematics of nature.

The problems and methods he established were the focus of astronomy and physics for more than a century.  Newtonian physics explained nearly all phenomena at the macroscopic level, including the origin and nature of gravitational and electromagnetic forces.  It also had a profound effect on the understanding of optics, acoustics, heat and the physical properties of matter.  Newton's work influenced the entirety of mechanics study until well into the 20th century.

The earliest devices for reproducing multiple copies of the same text was probably performed with painstakingly engraved woodblocks.  This technique dates back as early as 8th and 9th century China and Japan.  The Chinese also pioneered the use of movable type, in which individual elements could be arranged and printed, in the 11th century.  The complexity of China's ideographic language discouraged further development of this technique.

The earliest examples of European adoption of xylography (printing from carved woodblocks) appeared in the 14th century.  Various inventors experimented with both moveable wooden type and metallographic printing, which involved impressing metal type dies into clay to create a print plate.  In 1450, Johannes Gutenberg combined the use of moveable, reusable type with a press by which sharp impressions could be made many times over, on both sides of a sheet a paper.  Although the next 500 years saw many developments and refinements of the mechanics of this printing technique, the fundamental process remained the same.

Throughout the 1800s, most physicists considered Newton's dynamical laws sacred.  By the early 20th century, however, Newtonian physics proved inadequate to explain some newly discovered phenomena, like radiation.  Physicists began to apply the principles of quantum mechanics when dealing with the behavior of electrons and nuclei within atoms and molecules.  Although conventional quantum mechanics did not try to completely explain what occured inside the atomic nucleus, it helped scientists grasp the fundamentals of many processes, such as photodisintegration and the emission of alpha particles.  The field theory of quantum mechanics also provided insight into the properties of mesons, subatomic particles and nuclear phenomena.

[ADVANCE_RADAR_HISTORICAL]
Radar (from "radio detecting and ranging") is an electromagnetic sensor used for detecting, tracking, locating and identifying objects at either close or far ranges.  Its operation involves the transmission of electromagnetic energy towards objects and the observation of the echoes that are returned.  Objects, commonly called targets, may be vehicles, astronomical bodies, wildlife or even weather.  It can determine the presence, location and velocity of objects and gauge their size and shape as well.  It surpasses optical and infrared sensing devices with its ability to precisely detect objects at long ranges, through any weather conditions.

The 1930s and '40s saw a swift development of radar technology, largely to meet the demands of the military.  Although most radar developmental research was subsidized by the military, it found commercial applications in the late 20th century for air traffic control, air and sea navigation, environmental and weather sensing and surveillance.  Military applications include aiding antiaircraft operations, like mobile surface-to-air missile vehicles and flak towers and radar stations, whose specific purpose is the constant monitoring of a specific area.

[ADVANCE_ROBOTICS_HISTORICAL]
Although modern factories offered were reasonably efficient manufacturing entities, their owners were constantly searching for ways to minimize the element of human error inherent in the system.  The occasional worker illness or injury required not only an abundance of employees to keep assembly lines staffed but health and liability insurance to cover the economic costs as well.  Manufacturers also had to contend with worker inefficiency and, sometimes, theft of property, requiring both management staff to monitor worker progress and security systems to monitor worker conduct.  Finally, factories often had to deal with unions, government regulation and labor laws, which all cut into their bottom line.

Modern manufacturers saw a possible solution in robotics.  For many factories, the assembly system had been refined to require little more than unskilled machine operators and moderately skilled workers.  Robotic technology enabled factories to replace human workers with robots.  Although popular culture's notion of a robot was an intelligent, subservient humanoid machine, most robots were little more than machines specifically designed for a single task.  For instance, the automotive industry benefited from robotic technology, replacing human welders and tool users with robotic arms that could perform the same task within exceedingly low levels of error with only occasion maintenance.  Robotic plants and factories began to replace traditional human factories the world over.  The socio-economic and cultural implications of this shift were akin to the devaluation of human effort that occurred with the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Whereas pre-industrial artisans and craftsmen became little more than machine operators at that time, robotics began to cut human machine operators and workers completely out of the manufacturing process.

Well suited to lakes, streams and shallow oceans, these boats were used mainly for fishing and light transport.  Many skin boats were unsuitable for open sea travel, as the violence of the open seas was too much for their frail construction to bear.  They were easy to repair, though, and could be built from a wide range of available materials.

Slavery was an involuntary labor system in which the workers were deprived of a great deal of personal liberties.  It existed in many ancient societies, but was rare among primitive peoples, such as hunter-gatherer societies, because those societies lacked the social stratification that was essential to slavery's existence.  Primitive societies also lacked the economic surplus necessary to support a slave trade, since one of the aspects of slavery is the notion that slaves are assets by which slave owners prosper.

Although the precise origins of slavery are blurred by the fog of time, the earliest known slavery existed during the Shan dynasty (18th-12th century BC) in China.  Korea had a slave population that ranged from a third to a half of the entire population for most of the millennium between the Silla period and the mid-18th century.  Slavery also existed in ancient India and the Middle East for much of recorded history.  The Vikings often raided other civilizations looking for slaves to trade on the international slave market.  It is theorized that slavery was first invented as a system to make better use of criminals, postulating that they were more useful when put to work instead of being killed or eaten.  Regardless of its origins, slavery continued to occupy a place in almost every major culture well into the 20th century.

Materials that were able to dynamically respond to stimuli, or "smart" materials, first appeared in the 19th century in the form of a piezo-electric crystal that generated electrical fields when exposed to heat or to stress.  In the 22nd century, smart materials development exploded as the need for highly evolved plastics and ceramics rose.  Many were controlled by microprocessors and advanced feedback systems. They could act as muscles, contracting against unusual stresses, or materials that surpassed the strength of any conventional material.  Virtually any kind of function could be embedded in smart materials, from movement and energy response to light filtration.  These materials were indispensable in the efforts to colonized and explore the oceans.

On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched the satellite Sputnik 1 into orbit.  This action intensified an already heated rivalry between United States and Soviet space programs.  The U.S. launched their first satellite, Explorer 1, on January 31, 1958, a little less than four months after Sputnik 1.  Over the next decades, over 5,000 successful launches of satellites and space probes of various functions:  scientific, communications, meteorological, reconnaissance and navigation satellites as well as manned and unmanned lunar and planetary probes.  The Soviet Union launched the first man into Earth orbit on April 12, 1961.  The United States landed two men on the surface of the Moon on July 20, 1969.

On April 21, 1981, the 20th anniversary of manned space flight, the U.S. launched the Space Shuttle.  This date represented a major milestone in the history of space flight, for the Space Shuttle was the first reusable manned space vehicle.  It could be launched into space via rocket engines and could reenter the atmosphere and land in much the same way as an airplane.  Many Space Shuttles were launched over the next two decades on scientific research missions.

In 2047, scientists at the National Aeronautical and Space Administration launched the first orbital transport vehicle.  Primarily envisioned as a commercial and industrial cargo and transport craft, it was designed to launch into orbit and touch down within a few days.  Based on many of the design principles of the space shuttle, the Space Plane employed advanced composites to shield it against the friction and intense heat of atmospheric breach and fuel cell technology to propel its giant rocket engines.

The craft of building with stone or clay originated when prehistoric man sought to build more permanent shelters that mimicked the natural caves they used.  These early structures were often constructed without the use of cementing agents or binders, and involved rough or crudely cut stone or bricks.  Stones of various sizes could be erected in rows to provide walls for city defenses as well.  Different stone working techniques developed independent of each other in Sumer and Egypt in 4000 BC.  Ancient Sumerians made up for their lack of access to large stone deposits by building massive ziggurats out of fired clay bricks.  Egyptians hauled huge blocks of limestone over considerable distances to build the Pyramids.

On October 14, 1947, U.S. Air Force Major Charles E. Yeager piloted a Bell XS-1 rocket-powered research plane, the first aircraft to fly at supersonic speeds.  This flight marked the beginning of a revolution in flight technology.  Soon after, many supersonic-flight-capable aircraft were built, many of them able to achieve speeds of Mach 2 (2 times the speed of sound) or above.

Although supersonic flight's commercial applications were limited to the Concorde passenger aircraft, it changed the nature of air combat forever.  New weapons, guidance systems, tracking devices and early warning systems were needed to track high-altitude bombers and interceptors that could strike a target and, within seconds, be out of range of anti-aircraft guns.  A new class of fighter and assault planes emerged in the armies of the major world powers.  Planes could fly higher, farther and faster than previously possible.  Some planes were even capable of hypersonic flight - Mach 5 and above - but needed to be constructed of special materials to deal with the frictional heating of the skin of the plane.

[ADVANCE_TANK_WARFARE_HISTORICAL]
The primary thrust behind early tank developments was the quest for a well-armored assault vehicle that could effectively cross the muddy, uneven terrain of the World War I trench battle zones.  Armed with large bore guns and light cannon, they could strike both infantry units and reinforced installations, delivering explosive damage.  The Germans and Soviets were at the forefront of tank research throughout the Second World War, when tank warfare underwent its most rapid development.  

Germany's tank force was initially the most effective, due to its organization into rapid-moving formations that delivered unprecedented assault power.  During the first two years of battle, 1939-41, the German tank units suffered no major setbacks.  In 1943, Germany introduced the Panther tank. Armed with a 75-mm gun with more than twice the muzzle velocity of its predecessor, the Panther had great armor-piercing capabilities.  They also introduced the formidable Tiger tank, with an 88-mm gun.  The Soviet Union was the only allied force to meet the Germans head on.  In 1944, they rolled out the Josef Stalin tank, armed with a 122-mm low-velocity gun.

After World War II, tanks were designed primarily to fight other tanks.  Armies equipped them with larger, increasingly accurate guns, stronger, heavier armor and engines that were more powerful.  Modern battle tanks weigh as much as 50 tons, but possess engines of strength, making them capable of road speeds of 30-40 mph.

The technocracy form of government evolved out of two particularly distinct sets of political philosophies:  the growing cult of the technology-obsessed who saw in the advancement of science the answers to all of the world's ills, and the scattered remnants of authoritarian, fascist and reactionary thinkers who continued to bear the flag of totalitarianism as a viable political system.  The first technocratic nations were solidly based on a strict social hierarchy system that valued intelligence and aptitude, particularly for science and technology, above all else.  Industry and corporations were given free reign to conduct business in the most laissez faire markets the world had seen.

However, the economic upheavals of a free market system, combined with a rapidly expanding population of poor and disenfranchised people began to place a burden on the state.  Most technocrats had little patience for social issues, regarded education as a waste of resources on anyone but the extremely gifted.  In order to deal with the increasingly embittered throngs of masses cut off from better opportunities, technocracies relied on the military and police to enforce order.  Surveillance systems were ubiquitous, and prison systems expanded to accommodate for an influx of new criminals.  Technocracies were characterized by elitism, violations of personal freedom and an unprecedented zealousness in the pursuit of science.

[ADVANCE_THEOLOGY_HISTORICAL]
Theology was the study of God, man, the world, salvation and eschatology (or the study of "end" times).  It was a discipline almost exclusively limited to Christianity.  It's origins lie with the Greek philosopher Plato (c.428-c.348 BC), who was the first to put for theology as a field of study.  Although Plato's concept of theology dealt with Greek, not Christian, myths, the fundamental nature of the study came from him, namely: theology is the attempt of believers of a faith to represent their statements of belief consistently, to logically analyze them out of the fundamentals of their faith and to properly contextualize such statements within nature, history, reason and logic.

A scientific analysis of something as emotionally and ontologically complex as religious faith seemed incongruous to some people.  Nevertheless, theology has served to explicate and reinforce the central tenets of many faiths, and provided the basis for the Theocracy, a government based on religious law.

The origins of tool making can be found in prehistoric times, when early man employed naturally sharp stones to, among other things, dig, hunt and cut animal hides.  The human impulse to fashion useful items out of natural substances, such as stone, wood and bone is what set humans apart from other animals.  Tool making developed over the course of prehistory and was one of the advances that made ancient societies capable of feeding, clothing and defending themselves.  Advances continued, and in 11th millennium BC, Palestinian natives created reaping knives by setting flint blades into primitive handles.  Simple metal working dates back to 4500 BC, in which people fashioned ornamental and utilitarian items out of gold, silver and copper.  By heating and hammering metal, treating and tanning hides and cutting wood into virtually any shape, early civilizations could create a tool for almost all of their needs, from armaments to farming implements.

[ADVANCE_TRADE_HISTORICAL]
The proliferation of trade, internal and abroad, was essential to the economic vitality of many of the ancient empires.  Commerce was no longer limited to the goods within a city or country's own capacity to harvest and manufacture.  Foreign caravans would deliver exotic new foods, fabrics, luxuries and precious items.  Unfortunately, trade was a dangerous endeavor.  Bandits and other hostile forces threatened the livelihood of many merchants.  Contracts, laws and other fruits of jurisprudence helped mitigate the risk.

Trade had political and social ramifications as well.  Nations generally had to be on good terms in order to keep trade routes open.  As a result, consumer demand for foreign goods could powerfully influence a government's motivations to keep peaceful relations with trade partners.  Trade contributed to the international exchange of music, art, culture and science.  It motivated nations to fund the exploration of the world, to seek alternate trade routes and find new cultures and societies with which to exchange goods.

Unified Field Theory, also known as the "Unified Theory of Everything," was an attempt to describe all fundamental forces and the relationships between elementary particles within a single theoretical framework.  Physicists were able to describe forces by fields that mediate interactions between separate objects.  For instance, in the mid-19th century, James Clerk Maxwell formulated the first field theory in his theory of electromagnetism.  Then, in the early part of the 20th century, Albert Einstein developed a field theory of gravitation, known as general relativity.  Later, Einstein and others attempted to construct a unified field theory in which electromagnetism and gravity would emerge as different aspects of a single fundamental field. They did not succeed, and a unified field theory remained out of reach for the rest of the 20th century.  When 21st-century physicists succeeded in unraveling the mysteries of chaos theory, they were finally able to create the first unified theory of everything.

However, vertical flight demands more sophisticated control and power systems than fixed-wing aircraft.  Engineers and inventors overcame these demands and began to produce useful helicopters in the early 1940s.

Helicopters significantly affected military operations in the Korean and Vietnam Wars.  They fielded air-mobile infantry units, evacuated casualties, hauled artillery and ammunition, rescued downed aviators, and served as ground-attack craft.

[ADVANCE_VIRTUAL_DEMOCRACY_HISTORICAL]
The democratic form of government evolved over the period of several millenia.  Its first iterations manifested in the ancient Greek city-states, where the entire citizen body acted as the legislature.  This form of democracy, called direct democracy, was possible due to the relatively small populations of the city-states.  In modern times, representative and constitutional democracies flourished as nations grew and the sheer numbers of people made direct democracy impractical.  Though these other forms of democracy worked well, some political thinkers lamented the lack a pure "rule of the people" in which one vote per citizen truly had meaning.  Disillusionment with the Electoral College system and increased corruption in the United States government contributed to a growing desire to seek a pure democracy solution.

Technology provided the solution people were looking for.  By combining the vast reach of the Internet with the latest digital encryption technology, governments could set up high-tech voting centers, with powerful computers tallying votes from across the country.  Voters no longer punched holes in a card, they registered their vote through computer terminals.  The citizenry could act as legislature, voting on proposed legislation posted on official government web sites.  Local government, in particular, was revolutionized, as citizens who could hardly keep track of the machinations of their local city council could become the council themselves.  The focus shifted from people voting for candidates to represent them in government to people becoming active members of the government.  Although some virtual democracies suffered from voter apathy and conscientious non-participation, people had more power over the destiny of their country.  Moreover, most importantly, they came as close as ever to true, pure democratic rule.  Corporations lost their power to influence government through campaign contributions, congresspeople no longer misrepresented their constituencies and every human had the power to register their vote in a new and powerful way.  Because the era of the politician ended, people finally took control of their political and economic destinies.

Although the world is full of examples of prehistoric communication, most notably in the form of cave paintings, writing systems did not begin to appear until ancient times.  Writing systems developed in many ways.  Some cultures developed a meaning-based system, with characters and symbols that represented words, acts, and concepts, while others developed sound-based systems, with characters representing syllables or phonemes.  Whether pictographic, ideographic, alphabetic or phonetic, the writing system needed to match the demands of the societies' expressions and communications.  Nevertheless, writing was a giant leap forward in the establishment of history and culture for early societies, leading to a strengthening of social order, jurisprudence and historical preservation.

The Ancient Age represented the first iterations of human societies.  Across the world peoples began to abandon nomadic life in favor of settling near a river or fertile plain.  The discovery of agriculture, in part, made settlement possible, giving people the power to expand their tribe by feeding greater numbers of people.  Religion was often a major part of ancient societies, unifying people in times of struggle and uncertainty.  Jurisprudence, philosophy, drama and writing enriched ancient civilizations, proving social order, entertainment and intellectual stimulation.  Ancient times were marked by brutal and bloody conflicts, as nations sought to expand their territories and conquer their enemies.  Advancements in bronze and iron working, ship building and siege weapons fueled an almost constant state of war throughout the last four millennia BC.

[CONCEPT_ATROCITY_GAMEPLAY]
Atrocities are events so abominable and horrifying, they provoke the anger and condemnation of the world community.  In Call To Power II, certain special attacks, such as a <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_NUKE>Nuclear Attack<e>, <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_NANO_INFECT>Nano-Attack<e> or <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_CREATE_PARK>Nanite Cleansing<e> constitute atrocities.  Should a nation choose to engage in such nefarious warfare, they will assuredly find themselves having to answer to <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_DIPLOMAT>Diplomats<e> from foreign countries and may see a dramatic decrease in their <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e> with other nations.  

Players should consider this when building and deploying weapons of mass destruction.  Although such devices can be extraordinarily efficient and destructive means, in the end, the diplomatic consequences of atrocities may far outweigh the tactical benefits.

[CONCEPT_BARBARIANS_GAMEPLAY]
Barbarians are units that have no affiliation with any established empire on the map.  They roam the map and are hostile to any other unit or city they encounter.  Players should exercise caution, particularly in the early stages of building his or her empire, when dealing with Barbarians.

If a Barbarian unit manages to enter a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e>, it seizes control of it.

At the beginning of the game, players may choose between 4 different levels of Barbarian presence in the game - villages only, roving bands, restless tribes and raging hordes.  Each level has a graduated effect on the difficulty of the game.

[CONCEPT_CITY_GAMEPLAY]
Cities, and the management of them, are the prime focus of Call To Power II.  With them, players can build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_UNITS>Units<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> and Wonders.  They draw the three main resources, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e>, from the surrounding tiles.  As the population of a city expands, so does its influence.  Larger cities have more tiles from which to extract resources.

Building cities is the only way to expand an empire.  The more cities an empire has, the more terrain it controls, the more units it can build, and the more resources it has at its disposal.

The efficiency of one's cities can mean the difference between victory and defeat.  Players should strive to completely master the particulars of city management, including placement on terrain, use of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Buildings<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e> and controlling <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>.

[CONCEPT_COMMERCE_GAMEPLAY]
Commerce is one of the basic resources of the game.  Commerce represents the activity of buying, selling and trading goods and services in a city.  It produces <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e>, which pays for workers' <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WAGES>Wages<e> and funds <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SCIENCE>Science<e>.  Players can also use accumulated <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e> to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RUSH_BUY>Rush Buy<e> <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e>.

Commerce is one of the three basic resources in Call To Power II.  All <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> generate Commerce by working the tiles of land in and around the city.  The city limits (represented by a white dotted line drawn on the map) indicate from which tiles a city draws Commerce.  Terrain types have varying levels of Commerce, and certain <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e>, like the <L:DATABASE_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS,TILEIMP_TRADING_POST>Trading Post<e> and <L:DATABASE_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS,TILEIMP_OUTLET_MALL>Shopping Mall<e>, can help a city increase the amount of Commerce it creates. 

In order to discover <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advances<e>, one must fund scientific research.  Leaders may adjust the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SCIENCE_SETTING>Science Setting<e>, which determines what percentage of total Commerce goes to research.

Commerce represents the economic vitality of a city.  Cities draw on their Commerce to pay for maintenance costs on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>.  Cities may increase their Commerce by building <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> like <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_BANK>Banks<e> and <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_BROKERAGE>Brokerage Houses<e>.  They can also assign <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SPECIALISTS>Workers<e> to be <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SPECIALISTS>Merchants<e>.

To control the distribution of wealth in an empire, players can set the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WAGES>Wages<e> level for each citizen.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WAGES>Wages<e> level has a direct impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>, so it is wise to not underpay one's citizens.

When people feel that their needs are not met, they take matters into their own hands.  If this <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Unhappiness<e> reaches a certain level, the unfortunate by-product is criminal activity. 

In Call To Power II, Crime creates reductions in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e>, representing the "loss" of these basic elements to corruption and theft.

[CONCEPT_DIAMOND_AGE_HISTORICAL]
The Diamond Age was a period of intense scientific breakthroughs.  With the perfecting of nanotechnology and further developments in genetics, human beings possessed power over their lives and their worlds in ways that seemed unfathomable in previous centuries.  Human cloning and life extension enabled people to achieve immortality, as the limitations of the physical body no longer presented an obstacle.   More than any other science, nanotechnology affected the lives of citizens most profoundly.  Sub-microscopic machines called nanites could manipulate molecules, seek out nuclear weapons, eat pollution, release toxins and countless other tasks.  With the aid of nanites, entire cities were constructed underwater.  The power of nanites manifest in two disparate realms, however, and represented both the future and the demise of human life.  The Gaia Controller had the power to grant a new utopia in the world, by providing limitless supplies of resources.  However, Eco-Rangers could just as easily obliterate entire cities in a matter of minutes, leaving behind only pristine wilderness.  Though some saw this as a triumph, others feared the day that human beings sought to undue six millenia of evolution, progress and creation.  For all of its technological breakthroughs, the Diamond Age represented a world at a crossroads.  With the power of eternal life, limitless energy, and an end to material scarcity, people were finally in control of every aspect of their own destinies.  The only question that remained was whether people would live in peace or ultimately destroy themselves in the acts of nanotechnological war.
[END]

[CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY_GAMEPLAY]
Diplomacy is the art of negotiation.  It is also one of the central foci of the game.  Once a player makes contact with a foreign empire, he or she may engage in basic diplomatic relations.  <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_ESTABLISH_EMBASSY>Establishing Embassies<e> in foreign <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> open up more diplomatic options.

In Call To Power II, Diplomacy is conducted by sending proposals to other players.  Players can comprise diplomatic proposals from the following options: <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_OFFER>Offers<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REQUEST>Requests<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TREATIES>Treaties<e>.  Players comprise a proposal of any two of these elements, in any order, one in exchange for the other (e.g. a player may make an offer and request something in exchange, or propose a treaty in exchange for an offer.) The recipient weighs his or her own interests and agreements and responds by either accepting, rejecting or countering the proposal.

A player also has the option to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_THREAT>Threaten<e> the recipient should they disagree to the terms of their proposal.

Players can select the tone of voice with which they write the proposal.  A player should select his or her <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TONE>Tone<e> based on the recipient's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e> for them, because it can affect whether the recipient receives the proposal favorably, tentatively or rejects it outright.   Since Diplomacy has a considerable impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e>, it can be the key to keeping strong enemies at bay, exchanging <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e> for <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advances<e>, forging <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TREATIES>Military Agreements<e>, preserving peace and maintaining worldwide environmental standards.

The <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_VICTORY_DIPLOMATIC>World Peace Victory<e> is only attainable by the player who shrewdly engages his or her rivals in Diplomacy to the benefit of the world.  Once all nations form an <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ALLIANCE>Alliance<e> with the player, he or she wins the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_VICTORY_DIPLOMATIC>World Peace Victory<e>.

For a full list of all possible <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_OFFER>Offers<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REQUEST>Requests<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TREATIES>Treaties<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_THREAT>Threats<e>, and for a systematic description of the proposal process, please consult the game manual.

The <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e> may be in a poor location, vulnerable to attack or in some way unmanageable or undesirable.  One can only disband a city of size 3 or less.  Once disbanded, the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e> is eradicated and a <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_SETTLER>Settler<e> unit is created.

When a player embargoes a nation's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE>trade<e>, he or she is cutting off all trade relations with that nation.  The embargoed nation is unable to create <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE_ROUTE>trade routes<e> with the player's cities, which effectively prevents them from drawing any trade profits from them.  In Call To Power II, players can use the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_THREAT>threat<e> of embargo as a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>diplomatic<e> weapon.  Once an embargo is in place, the player can <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_OFFER>offer<e> to end the embargo.

If a player's empire is too large for the current <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type, the citizens will become <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Unhappy<e>.

[CONCEPT_FOOD_GAMEPLAY]
Food is one of the fundamental resources of the game.  All <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> grow and harvest Food by working the tiles of land in and around the city.  The city limits (represented by a white dotted line drawn on the map) indicate from which tiles a city draws Food.  Different terrain types grow varying levels of Food, and <L:DATABASE_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS,TILEIMP_FARMS>Farm<e> <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> can help a city increase their Food production.  

If a city produces more Food than it consumes, it will store it.  If a city begins consuming more than it can produce, it will draw from any available food stores.  If it depletes its stores, the city will starve and people will die, reducing population.

To control the distribution of Food at the empire level, the player can set the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RATIONS>Rations<e> level for each citizen.  The higher the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RATIONS>Rations<e> level, the more Food is distributed and the quicker food stores are depleted.  If an empire's Food production cannot support the rations level, it will be automatically decreased.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RATIONS>Rations<e> level has a direct impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>.

With the deciphering of the mysteries of human life at the hands of researchers involved in the Human Genome Project, the Genetic Age built on the solid foundation of scientific achievement established in the Modern Age.  What distinguished the Genetic Age from the Modern Age was an collective increase in responsibility towards humanity and the environment.  Whereas technology continued to streamline the process of manufacturing, it also found equally powerful ways to help curb pollution.  Human mastery of the physical world continued at breakneck pace with the applications of chaos theory and unified physics.  More than anything else, the achievements of the Genetic Age began to blur the lines between human and machine.  Neural interfaces enabled people to control computers with their thoughts.  Medical scientists began to apply their knowledge of genetics towards not only the eradication of disease but the customization of all forms of life.  As the computer revolutionized the lives of people in the 20th century, so did genetics irrevocably alter life in the 21st century.

[CONCEPT_GOLD_GAMEPLAY]
Gold is the currency of Call to Power II, and one of the key resources in the game.

The most common way to generate Gold in one's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> is through Commerce.  Like <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> or <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> is one of the three basic elements that a city can extract from tiles within its area of influence.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, such as <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_BROKERAGE>Brokerages<e>, can also increase the amount of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e>, and therefore Gold, a city produces.

Trade is the other common way to produce Gold.  A robust and vibrant web of trade routes can bring in substantial profits.  In <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>Diplomacy<e>, empires can offer or request Gold in exchange for advances, actions and diplomatic favor.

Each terrain type has a common good, which has a higher chance of appearing, and a rare good.  A good on a tile within the range of influence of a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e> enables that city to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE>Trade<e> that Good.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE>Trade<e> generates profits for the city, in the form of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e>.

If one <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TERRAFORM>Terraforms<e> a tile with a Good on it, that Good is permanently eradicated.  If a tile with a Good on it becomes a dead tile, the Good is lost as well.

[CONCEPT_GROWTH_GAMEPLAY]
The Growth Rating indicates how quickly <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> increase their <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_POPULATION>Population<e>.  Several factors contribute to the growth rate, including the distribution of labor in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> that promote growth and the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type under which a leader rules his or her empire.

The disposition of one's citizens is an important thing to monitor in Call To Power II.  An effective leader strives to act in the best interests of his or her people, and always has their Happiness in mind.  Leaders who do not meet the needs and desires of their people cultivate an embittered, resentful, and even angry populace.  These citizens begin protesting and rioting to express their discontent.  Eventually, if their cries go unanswered, they rise up in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REVOLUTION>Revolution<e> and take control of their own destinies.

Improvements do not come without a price.  A city must build them from the pool of available <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources, which determines how long it takes to build.  Once complete, each Improvement has a maintenance cost that is paid in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e> from the empire's treasury.

[CONCEPT_MILITARY_READINESS_GAMEPLAY]
The Military Readiness setting determines the support costs of existing units and affects their health ratings.  There are three military readiness states:  At War, On Alert and At Peace.  

When At War, all units are fully trained and ready to fight.  They incur full support costs and have full health (until attacked).
On Alert status has reduced support costs.  Because of this, unit health suffers a decrease, reflecting the lower level of support.
The At Peace setting reduces unit support costs and health even further.  Therefore, although units are cheaper to maintain at lower readiness levels, they are not as equipped for battle.

It takes several turns to change military readiness settings.  Leaders should consider this when planning their military activity.

The Modern Age was marked by an explosion of growth in the areas of human industry and ingenuity.  New manufacturing techniques brought on by the Industrial Revolution contributed to an increase in the productive power of cities.  Breakthroughs in science, such as electricity, quantum physics and modern medicine led to the development of televisions, airplanes and hospitals.  Railroads crisscrossed nearly every continent, expanding the speed and efficacy of transport and travel.  The invention of the internal combustion engine led to the rise of the automobile as the dominant form of land transportation in the mid 20th century.  By the end of the modern age, computers had pervaded every aspect of human life.  They facilitated more rapid scientific research, intercontinental communications, and global commerce.  Despite these leaps in human understanding and productivity, the modern age bore witness to a staggering array of new warfare technology.  From machine guns and tanks to nuclear missiles and stealth aircraft, battlefields heated up as science begat newer and better ways to destroy life.  As technology began to exponentially increase, new questions about the role of technology in society, the responsibility of scientists and even the eventual obsolescence of humanity at the hands of future advances plagued the thinkers of the age.

A good leader can effectively manage Pollution on an Empire and City level.  However, one must use <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>Diplomacy<e> if he or she wants to make an affect on Global Pollution.  Nations may propose Pollution Pacts and demand that they be adhered to.

Some <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, such as <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_FACTORY>Factories<e> and <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_OIL_REFINERY>Oil Refineries<e>, create Pollution, whereas others, like <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_RECYCLING_PLANT>Recycling Plants<e>, reduce it.  Factors such as nuclear warfare can increase Pollution, while some <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e> of the World can help reduce it.

An excess of Pollution will surely upset one's citizens.  The specific Pollution level that they are willing to tolerate depends on one's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type.

If cities allow pollution to reach toxic levels, the terrain within their area of influence will be damaged beyond use.  Once the Advance <L:DATABASE_ADVANCES,ADVANCE_CONSERVATION>Conservation<e> is discovered, however, these "dead tiles" can be <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TERRAFORM>Terraformed<e> back to useful terrain.
[END]

[CONCEPT_POLLUTION_HISTORICAL]
[END]

[CONCEPT_POPULATION_GAMEPLAY]
Each city has a Population, representing the total number of citizens who live there.  As a city's Population grows, so does it's productivity.  With each increase in Population, another <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORKER>Worker<e> adds to the resource-gathering potential of a city.
[END]

[CONCEPT_POPULATION_HISTORICAL]
[END]

[CONCEPT_PRODUCTION_GAMEPLAY]
Production is one of the three basic resources in Call To Power II.  All <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> generate Production by working the tiles of land in and around the city.  The city limits (represented by a white dotted line drawn on the map) indicate from which tiles a city draws Production.  Different terrain types have varying levels of Production, and mining <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> can help a city increase the amount of Production it creates. 

Production represents the combination of human labor, natural resources and raw materials that are required for industry.  Cities draw on their Production to build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_UNITS>Units<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e>.  Cities may increase their Production by building <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e>.  They can also assign <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORKER>Workers<e> to be <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SPECIALISTS>Laborers<e>.

In order to build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TERRAFORM>Terraform<e> tiles, leaders must dedicate a portion of the total Production output of their empire to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PUBLIC_WORKS>Public Works<e>.

To control the productivity of an empire, players can set the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e> level for each citizen.  The longer the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e>, the more <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORKER>Workers<e> produce.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e> length has a direct impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>, so it is wise to not overwork one's citizens.

[CONCEPT_PUBLIC_WORKS_GAMEPLAY]
Players can use Public Works to build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TERRAFORM>Terraform<e> terrain.  Drawn from the total <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> output of the empire, Public Works represents a specialized labor force dedicated to building infrastructure.  Leaders can set the percentage of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> that goes to Public Works in the Empire Manager.
[END]

[CONCEPT_PUBLIC_WORKS_HISTORICAL]
[END]

[CONCEPT_RATIONS_GAMEPLAY]
Rations are the amount of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> each citizen consumes per turn.  It is extracted from the total <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> produced every turn.  Leaders should be careful setting the Rations level for their empire - how much <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> people have to eat has a direct and measurable impact on their <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>.

If the rations level exceeds the available amount of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>, it will make up the difference by dipping into food stores.  If these stores are depleted, the Rations level will automatically drop to a more manageable level.
[END]

[CONCEPT_RATIONS_HISTORICAL]
[END]

[CONCEPT_REGARD_GAMEPLAY]
Regard is the worth and estimation that other empires hold for the player.  Empires base their Regard on their level of trust, esteem and respect that they have for other nations and their leaders.  Foreign leaders not only consider how the player acts towards them but how he or she acts towards all nations.  That is why it is important to consider one's actions and the effects on one's reputation.

In Call To Power II, Regard is the key to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>Diplomacy<e>, and should be carefully monitored if one has any hope of success at the negotiations table.

[CONCEPT_RENAISSANCE_AGE_GAMEPLAY]
[END]

[CONCEPT_RENAISSANCE_AGE_HISTORICAL]
After the tumult of the Dark Ages in Europe, nations struggled to come to grips with their historical, cultural and national identities.   Particularly in Italy, the Renaissance sparked a renewed interest in the period of Greek and Roman dominance known as the classical period.  As the thinkers of the age grappled with the wisdom of the ancients, they opened up new frontiers in science, art, philosophy and culture.  Mimicking their ancestors' interest in the physical world, the great minds of the Renaissance began to explore the fields of optics, chemistry, physics and astronomy.  Advancements in shipbuilding made larger, more powerful ships available for exploration and warfare.  More than anything, the discovery of gunpowder changed the nature of war.  As strong nations equipped their soldiers with muskets and cannon, cultures still relying on catapults, archers and swordsmen were easily wiped out and conquered.  International trade proliferated as ships laden with exotic goods traveled the seven seas, bringing spices to Europe, muskets to Asia and horses to the New World.
[END]

[CONCEPT_REQUEST_GAMEPLAY]
A Request is one of the three diplomatic options players have in formulating proposals.

Requests may involve asking for <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e> or a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e>.  They may be calls to honor agreements or reduce unconventional weapons arsenals.  In a proposal, players may combine them with either an <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_OFFER>Offer<e> or a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TREATIES>Treaty<e>.  One cannot make a proposal comprised of two Requests.
[END]

[CONCEPT_REQUEST_HISTORICAL]
[END]

[CONCEPT_REVOLUTION_GAMEPLAY]
Revolution causes a city to break free from their empire and form a completely new nation.  Any city near a newly revolted city also has a chance of Revolution.

A city will revolt under several circumstances.  Either <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e> drops to a low enough point that people rise up to rule themselves, or a foreign <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_SPY>Spy<e> or <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_CYBER_NINJA>Cyber Ninja<e> incites a Revolution.  <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_ABOLITIONIST>Abolitionists<e> can aid a slave revolt in a city that has slaves as well.

[CONCEPT_RIOTS_GAMEPLAY]
When <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> reach a certain level of unhappiness, outraged citizens take to the streets and riot.  When a city riots, it effectively shuts down, generating no <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> or <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SCIENCE>Science<e> until <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e> improves or armed forces <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_FORTIFY>Garrison<e> inside the city to enforce martial law.

[CONCEPT_RIVER_GAMEPLAY]
Rivers add value to the terrain through which they flow.  They increase the amount of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> on a tile, and makes travel easier by reducing terrain-based movement costs.

Although <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_UNITS>Units<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e> with available <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources, a player may wish to speed up the build process by throwing money at it.  The Rush Buy function enables players to do just that.  The cost of a Rush Buy varies based on the particular item, its <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> cost and the time remaining to build.

[CONCEPT_RUINS_GAMEPLAY]
As units explore the map, they may come across a tile with ruins on it.  A unit that enters the Ruins may discover a new Advance, find treasure in the form of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e>, uncover a lost <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e>, or meet wandering nomads or mercenaries.  Players should beware, though - ruins are havens for <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_BARBARIANS>Barbarians<e>, who never hesitate to ambush unsuspecting <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_UNITS>Units<e> who come to investigate.

[CONCEPT_SCIENCE_GAMEPLAY]
In order to research <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advances<e>, an empire must generate <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SCIENCE>Science<e>.  The most common way to do this is to devote a portion of the total <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commercial<e> output of one's empire to scientific research.  Each city also can generate <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SCIENCE>Science <e>by turning <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORKER>Workers<e> into <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SPECIALISTS>Scientists<e>, or building <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> that boost Science.

[CONCEPT_SCIENCE_SETTING_GAMEPLAY]
The Science Setting represents the percentage of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> that is devoted to scientific research.  The higher the setting, the better funded and more capable of discovery one's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SPECIALISTS>Scientists<e> are.

Built exclusively by <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_SEA_ENGINEER>Sea Engineer<e> units, Sea Colonies are <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> on the floor of the ocean.  They have all the same aspects of traditional land <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e>, except they cannot build any pre-<L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_MODERN_AGE>Modern Age<e> <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>.

[CONCEPT_SLAVE_GAMEPLAY]
Slaves are <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORKER>Workers<e> who do not enjoy the benefit of citizenship.  They are prisoners, in a sense, forced to work in a foreign city for no pay.  Slaves only eat half of the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> of standard <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORKER>Workers<e>.

An empire can only acquire slaves by sending <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_SLAVER>Slavers<e> on slave raids in neighboring empires.  The act of enslaving others is seen as a grave offense and may enrage other nations.

[CONCEPT_SPECIAL_FORCES_GAMEPLAY]
Special Forces units are a subset of military units whose military readiness status is always "At War."  In this way, they are always ready for battle, unaffected by global <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_MILITARY_READINESS>Military Readiness<e> settings, incurring full support costs at all times.

[CONCEPT_SPECIALISTS_GAMEPLAY]
Specialists represent groups of citizens who are not primarily involved in the collection of resources.  Rather, they can help boost certain specific resources in order to achieve a particular goal in the city.  Each specialist is enabled by a specific <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advance<e> and will be unavailable the advance is discovered.

There are five types of specialists:
Entertainers - enabled by <L:DATABASE_ADVANCES,ADVANCE_DRAMA>Drama<e> - Increase <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e> in the city
Merchants - enabled by <L:DATABASE_ADVANCES,ADVANCE_ECONOMICS>Economics<e> - Increase <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e> in the city
Scientists - enabled by <L:DATABASE_ADVANCES,ADVANCE_CLASSICAL_EDUCATION>Classical Education<e> - Increase <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SCIENCE>Science<e> in the city
Laborers  - enabled by <L:DATABASE_ADVANCES,ADVANCE_INDUSTRIAL_REVOLUTION>Industrial Revolution<e> - Increase <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> in the city

[CONCEPT_STARVATION_GAMEPLAY]
The more people there are in a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e>, the more <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> the city must produce to feed them.  For each turn a city fails to produce enough food, the city starves.  Each city can endure a state of starvation for up to three turns.  After three turns, the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_POPULATION>city size<e> decreases by one.

Fortunately, there are three <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> that increase a city's food storage capacity and, therefore, increase a city's starvation "protection."  The <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_GRANARY>Granary<e> increases a city's starvation protection to five turns; the <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_FOOD_SILO>Food Silo<e> increases it to ten turns. Build a <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_CORNUCOPIC_VATS>Cornucopic Vats<e> improvement will insure that a city will never starve.

[CONCEPT_STEALTH_UNITS_GAMEPLAY]
Stealth Units are some of the more powerful units in Call To Power II.  Primarily, any entity with normal vision (standard units, cities, listening posts) cannot see stealth units - they are only visible to each other.  In addition, almost all Stealth Units have unconventional attacks.  They can siphon <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e>, interrupt <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e>, raise and lower <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>, steal <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advances<e> and information or wage war with weapons of mass destruction.

Players are wise to do everything they can to prevent Stealth Unit attacks.
[END]

[CONCEPT_STEALTH_UNITS_HISTORICAL]
[END]

[CONCEPT_SUPPORT_COST_GAMEPLAY]
Waging war is not without its price.  When a city builds a unit, the cost of that unit is measured in the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources it takes to build it.  Once built, however, the unit incurs an additional cost of maintaining its health and training.  This Military Support cost is extracted from the total <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> output of an empire.  The larger the military, the more strain on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources it has. 

Several things can affect Military Support costs, including <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e> and the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_MILITARY_READINESS>Military Readiness<e> Setting.

[CONCEPT_TERRAFORM_GAMEPLAY]
Terraforming is the process of converting one terrain type into another.  As empires expand all over the world, the need for good land becomes dire.  Fortunately, players can use <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PUBLIC_WORKS>Public Works<e> resources to Terraform undesirable terrain tiles into more useful, more productive land.  As a player progresses through the technology tree, certain key <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advances<e> enable the Terraforming of different terrain types.

[CONCEPT_THREAT_GAMEPLAY]
When a rival empire rejects or counters a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>Diplomatic<e> proposal, a leader may find it necessary to Threaten them with action in order to force them to agree.  Other leaders never take Threats likely, and for good reason.  To Threaten another with, for instance, <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_ATTACK>Attacking<e> a city, or <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_INTERCEPT_TRADE>Pirating<e> their trade routes can run the risk of making them angry.  One may jeopardize their diplomatic <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e> if the find themselves in the habit of using Threats often.

[CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS_GAMEPLAY]
Tile Improvements serve several purposes.  Some Tile Improvements, like Roads and Underwater Tunnels, increase mobility and reduce movement costs associated with terrain.  Others, like Farms, Mines and Drilling Platforms, boost the amount of Food, Commerce and Production that Workers collect.  Still, others increase visibility, radar range and defensive capabilities.

The cost of Tile Improvements is drawn from the pool of available Public Works resources, which is, in turn, extracted from the total Production output of an empire.  Unlike city <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, Tile Improvements do not have a maintenance cost, nor can one sell them.  Enemy units can <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_PILLAGE>Pillage<e> Tile Improvements and destroy them, negating any effects they have on the tile.

Leaders must select a Tone of voice for each diplomatic proposal they send, as it has an impact on how the recipient responds.  Players should check their <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e> with the recipient nation and before selecting Tone.  Misjudging such a thing can prove disastrous to the diplomatic process.  Likewise, players should review the proposals they receive with an ear for Tone.  It may reveal details about the sender's personality, intentions and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e> that may not be readily apparent in the content of the missive.

Trade is one of the primary methods for accumulating Gold in the game.  Once one discovers the <L:DATABASE_ADVANCES,ADVANCE_TRADE>Trade<e> Advance, one can build <L:DATABASE_UNITS,UNIT_CARAVAN>Caravans<e>.  If a player has <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOODS>Goods<e> within their <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City's<e> area of influence, they can set up a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE_ROUTE>Trade Route<e> either within their empire or with a foreign city.

[CONCEPT_TRADE_ROUTE_GAMEPLAY]
Players may create trade routes, in which Caravans (and later, Freight Transports) carry goods between <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> both foreign and domestic.  A line between two <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> indicates a trade route.  Players can tell at a glance what <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> are trading by a small icon, representing the trade good, that travels along the line.
Empires can pirate the trade routes of their rivals once per turn.  The trade route is not destroyed.  Rather, the pirates abscond with that the profits for that turn.  Piracy is considered an act of aggression and usually has diplomatic consequences.

[END]

[GOVERNMENT_ANARCHY_HISTORICAL]
Anarchy was the absence of formal government.  Although many philosophers and political thinkers, particularly 19th century French writer Pierre Joseph Proudhon, considered anarchy a viable alternative to government, it was historically regarded as an undesirable state of lawlessness and chaos.  Its advocates considered the so-called natural laws of man to be sufficient to govern a society, but history has shown that anarchy serves few interests.  

The vacuum of power that existed after the fall of the Roman Empire was a testament to the terrible state of affairs that exists in the absence of a governing body.  The military roamed the countryside commandeering supplies from farms while imperial tax collectors increased their demands.  Farmers, unable to make a living abandoned their fields and went to work for large landholders, or turned to robbery.  Germanic tribes settled in these abandoned lands and established power centers.  Romans experienced food shortages for the first time in centuries, trade became dangerous, commerce collapsed and the complex systems that sustained the vast Roman Empire ceased for lack of support.  Eventually, bitterness and hatred towards authority manifest itself in riots, massacres and widespread crime.

[GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_HISTORICAL]
The essential concept of the republic form of government was that sovereignty resided in the people, who delegated their power to elected representatives and officials.  Historically, this concept was distorted and corrupted, making conventional definition of the term "republic" difficult.  Throughout history, republics took the form of democracies (most notable, the United States) and monarchies, but the term was applied and used by dictatorships, one-party states as well.  The roots of this confusion lie in the origins of the republic.

The concept of the republic (from the Latin res publica, literally "public thing") originated with the two most exceptional thinkers of ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle.  Plato, in his famous work "Republic," presented the ideal state, in the form of the Greek polis ("city-state"), which was based on what he regarded as the basic characteristics of the human soul:  the appetitive, the spirited and the philosophical.  Accordingly, his republic consisted of three groups:  a commercial class comprised of those dominated by their appetites; a spirited class of administrators and soldiers responsible for the execution of laws; and the guardians or philosopher-kings, who would act as lawmakers.  Because Plato empowered the guardians, a small group, with the responsibility of maintaining harmony, republicanism was traditionally associated with goals or policies established by a carefully selected part of the community who presumably had a special insight into what constituted the common good.

Aristotle's concept of republic prevailed in much of the Western world.  He categorized governments based on who ruled:  the one, the few, or the many.  Within these categories, he distinguished good and perverted forms of government, for instance, monarchy (good) compared to tyranny, and aristocracy (good) compared to oligarchy.  His rationale for labeling different governments depended on whether the rulers governed for the good of the state or for their own interests.  Aristotle's distinction between democracy, a perverted form of rule by the many, and polity, the good form, was most relevant to the Western concept of republic.  He maintained that democracies were predisposed to turbulence and instability, because the poor, assumed to be the majority in a democracy, would demand an economic and social equality that stifled individual initiative and enterprise.  Polity, by contrast, would be rule "by the many" without chaos, as its middle class would capably adjudicate conflicts between the rich and the poor.

Theocracies were nations whose religious and state laws were based on the same doctrines.  The separation of the state from the church did not exist.

Monasteries became the bureaucratic backbone of Europe, handing such things as mail, trade and taxation.  The various "barbarian" states that contributed to the fall of Rome turned to the church for guidance in establishing governments.  Many of them established monarchies loyal to the central theocracy, expanding the power of the church even further.  In the modern era, some muslim nations established theocracies, ruled by supreme religious figures, and where Islamic law governed every aspect of life.

Tyranny was, in many ways, the oldest form of government.  Tyrants derived their power from nothing more than their ability to physically enforce it.  The tyrant was obligated to his or her subjects for the protection, stewardship and welfare of the people.  Tyranny was always one of the most tenuous forms of government.  Since its basis of power was so easily shaken, tyrants generally did not last long.  They could rarely extract any fealty from their subjects, as they often stayed in charge merely for the lack of sufficient forces to overthrow them.  Furthermore, because tyranny relied on the size and power of the military or police force, larger empires became unmanageable and were subject to revolution.

[IMPROVE_ACADEMY_HISTORICAL]
The original ancient Greek Academeia was located on the northwestern periphery of Athens on a piece of property acquired by Plato in 387 BC.  It consisted of an olive grove, park and gymnasium, and was primarily a college of philosophy.  Organized for the worship of the Muses, the Academy instructed young men in mathematics, dialectics and natural science.  Those who attended were of noble birth as the these schools' primary intent was to prepare patrician boys for lives as statesmen.  A scholarch (or headmaster) was elected for life by a majority of the members of the corporate body that organized the school.  Plato himself taught there until the end of his life, and often gave public lectures on diverse subjects.

The Academy went through many changes of philosophy throughout the centuries of its operation.  It was, but for a brief period in which Arcesilaus ran the school, a center of Platonism until AD 529, when the emperor Justinian closed it and all other pagan schools.  The moniker academy also applied not only to Plato's famous institution but to schools of philosophy during the time of the Roman orator and statesman, Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BC).

[IMPROVE_AIRPORT_HISTORICAL]
Before the introduction of heavy transport monoplanes, such as the Douglas DC-3, in the late 1930s, landing strips did not need to be very long, nor did they have to be paved.  In fact, airports in London (Croydon), Paris (Le Bourget) and Berlin (Tempelhof) used grass strips for both takeoff and landing.  Prewar airfields were situated close to city centers, and were centers of leisure activity, often attracting more visitors than passengers.  In 1939, La Guardia Airport in New York attracted nearly 250,000 visitors per month, reaching a peak of 7,000 in one day, compared with maximum daily number of only 3,000 passengers.  In 1929, Berlin's airport boasted three quarters of a million visitors and prided themselves on a restaurant on the roof of the passenger terminal capable of seating 3,000 people.  Airports were major centers of social activity, and the requirements of aircraft and passengers were ancillary to the need for top-shelf catering, observational decks and other services.

Modern airports grew in the 50s and 60s with the burgeoning of air travel.  By the end of the 20th century, approximately 50 airports around the world handled more than 10 million passengers per year, half of which were in the United States.  Six airports moved 30 million passengers a year, with O'Hare International Airport in Chicago handling 60 million.  Airfields contained several long, paved runways and taxiways to accomodate large, multiple jet- and turboprop-powered transport aircraft.  Extensive ground facilities, fire fighting and rescue services, passenger- and cargo-handling facilities, parking and public transit access, lighting, navigation aids all supported the operation of the airport.  Other facilities, such as catering, shopping, meteorology and government inspection also became essential.  Airports, for convenience's sake, needed to be within reasonable distance of a major urban area, but adequately distant, so that the environmental problems associated with large aircraft and large numbers of passengers, workers and visitors did not become untenable for the cities themselves.

[IMPROVE_AQUA_FILTER_HISTORICAL]
The development of nanotechnology introduced several new ways to dramatically reduce pollution.  The Aqua Filter, invented in the late 21st century, utilized two basic nano-machine types in order to meet the demands of increasingly larger cities for clean, fresh water.  It filtered sewage and agricultural runoff with nanite "scrubbers" that extracted pure water from the waste.  In addition, it deployed nanites into parts of the water supply, which searched for impurities, harmful chemicals and waste products and eliminated them.  This made the city's water supply vastly more reusable, making water available to more people without depleting natural sources of water.

[END]

[IMPROVE_AQUEDUCT_HISTORICAL]
Perhaps the most famous Roman masonry achievement was their system of water-bearing aqueducts.  The vast system that served the capital of the Roman Empire was a feat of engineering.  From 312 BC to 226 AD, Roman engineers built 11 aqueducts, some of which remained in use until modern times, designed to bring water to Rome from as far away as 57 miles.  Contrary to modern belief, only about 30 miles of about 260 miles of aqueducts crossed over valleys on stone arches; most of the system consisted of underground conduits made of stone and terracotta pipe, wood, leather, lead and bronze.  Water flowed by the force of gravity alone and usually went through a series of distribution tanks in the city.  Excess water was not stored, but rather used to flush out Rome's elaborate sewer system and supply the famous fountains.  The Romans constructed aqueducts throughout their empire, and remnants of stone arches in Greece, Italy, France, Spain, North Africa and Asia Minor survived well into modern times.

[IMPROVE_ARENA_HISTORICAL]
The Roman Empire created some of largest, most sophisticate entertainment venues in the ancient age.  Arenas and amphitheatres were designed to suit the specific forms of entertainment that the Romans loved, namely, gladiatorial conflicts and venationes, "animal hunts" involving men hunting exotic beasts or, occasionally, beasts hunting each other.  Originally, this kind of entertainment took place in a city's forum, with wooden stands erected to seat spectators.  One of the first permanent entertainment arenas was at Pompeii.  Built around 80 BC, it accommodated about 20,000 spectators.  Other large arenas were found at Verona and Capua.  The most famous arena, the Colosseum, was in Rome itself.  Remains of more than 75 Roman arenas have been found scattered about the Mediterranean, including ones at Nimes and Arles in France, Pula in Istria (Croatia), Thysdrus (El Djem) in Africa and at Caerleon in Gwent, Wales.

An average-sized arena was about 200 to 300 feet long and about 115 to 200 feet wide, and rose 50 to 95 feet about the ground.  Most had a labyrinthine network of passages, cages and rooms all ingeniously connected with the arena above by trap doors.  A system of elevators and machines were used to hoist animals and stage sets through the doors into the arenas.  Around the main arena, a metal screen-topped high wall rose to the spectator seats, which were divided into several sections.  In the lowest section, or podium, the emperor and his attendants sat in a special box.  On the opposite side of the arena sat consuls, praetors, ambassadors, priest, vestal virgins and other persons of distinction.  The rest of the podium contained senators and those of equestrian rank.  The second gallery accommodated patricians, the third plebeians and the fourth, women, who were seated in boxes.  A large awning could be manipulated to shield spectators from the sun.

Ballistae are massive projectile weapons, fashioned much like a giant crossbow.  They are capable of firing huge bolts of wood, often as large as 5 feet in length, a considerable distance.

Ballistae were ancient heavy missile launchers used to hurl large bolts, javelins or heavy balls great distances.  Smaller ballistae, like those in ballista towers, were essentially large crossbows fastened to a mount.  The smaller ballistae were better suited to defense against siege weapons and infantry attacks and were often perched high on the towers of towns and castles to rain a variety of projectiles on charging armies.

[END]

[IMPROVE_BANK_HISTORICAL]
Little was known about banking prior to the 13th century, but it was certainly of ancient origin.  Since most of their business was the exchange of foreign and domestic coin of teh correct weight and fineness, early banks dealt primarily in coin and bullion.  Merchant bankers dealt in goods as well as bills of exchange, providing for the transfer of money and payment of accounts over great distances without the need for sending coin money.  This was made possible by the fact that many merchants traded internationally and held assets at various points along trade routes.

17th century bankers, particularly the English, began to develop a deposit banking business, and their techniques influenced other banking systems.  London goldsmiths kept money and valuables safe for their customers and dealt in bullion and foreign exchange, making a profit off the acquisition, sorting and exchange of foreign coin.  People began to deposit money with goldsmiths and "money scriveners" (notaries specializing in bringing together borrowers and lenders), and, over time, it was discovered that when a number of people did this, deposits and withdrawals tended to even out.  Customers also began to prefer to leave their surplus money with goldsmiths, keeping only enough for everyday needs.  The resultant fund of idle cash became available for loans, with interest, to other parties.

Around the same time, a new practice emerged whereby a customer could transfer part of his credit balance to another party by addressing an order to the banker.  This was the origin of the modern check, a method of payment that proved so convenient that, in Britain, the public began using checks for most monetary transactions, using coin (and, later, notes) for small payements.  Banks then began granting their borrowers the right to draw checks in excess of their cash holdings, "creating" money in the form of credit.  This money consisted of nothing more than figures in the banks' ledgers, but it was publicly accepted due to confidence in the banks' abilities to honor their liabilities.

[IMPROVE_BASCILICA_HISTORICAL]
Originally, the term "basilica" referred to any of several kinds of large, roofed public buildings in ancient Rome, be they markets, courthouses, promenades or meeting halls.  Eventually, the word began to refer to a specific style of building:  rectangular, with an open hall extending from end to end, usually flanked by side aisles set off by colonnades, with raised platforms at one or both ends.  During the 1st century BC, basilicae were increasingly used for judicial purposes.  The platform was enclosed by a semicircular half-domed protrusion of the end wall called an apse.   The exterior was often simple and unadorned.  The interior, by contrast, often housed elaborate ornamentation on the many wall, ceiling and column surfaces.

The basilica style of building, with its long central hall, aisles and apse, became the blueprint for church buildings in the Western Church.  The Eastern Church, however, embraced a radial style of building, as demonstrated by the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.  The term basilica evolved once again, and in the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, was a canonical title of honor given to churches of particular distinction.   The Church bestows the title of basilica on sites renowned for either their antiquity, historical significance or association with a major saint.  These churches enjoyed certain privileges, including the right to reserve its high altar for the pope, a cardinal or a patriarch.

Although battlement technology reached its peak in the first part of the 20th century, by World War II advancement in aircraft and infantry tactics rendered battlements obsolete, and they were abandoned in favor of surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft guns.

[IMPROVE_BEHAVIORAL_MOD_CENTER_HISTORICAL]
One of the most troubling aspects of the modern criminal justice system was its inability to properly rehabilitate criminals into productive members of society.  Once prosecuted, criminals would enter correctional facilities, serve their time and return to the streets with little "correction" at all.  Most of them would become recidivists, or habitual criminals, and spend the better part of the lives in and out of the prison system.

When neural reprogramming systems found wide use in medicine in the late 21st and early 22nd centuries, law enforcement organizations urged correctional facilities to develop a system of rehabilitation that uses brain cell replacement as a means of eliminating recidivism.  The Behavioral Modification Facility sought employed neural reprogramming to great effect and dramatically reduced crime and repeat criminal activity.

The great Assyrian king Sargon II established Dur Sharrukin (Akkadian, meaning "Sargon's Fortress"), a city northeast of Nineveh near the modern Iraqi city of Khorsabad.  The city, enclosed by a wall pierced by seven fortified gates, covered one square mile.  The towering palace included a temple to Nabu (a god of vegetation and the patron saint of the art of writing), a royal palace, and several residences for important officials. With capitols such as these, rulers could impress both subjects as well as rivals, protecting themselves from riot, invasion, and starvation.

The Anasazi Indians built their homes directly into the face of cliffs for protection, whereas, the Aztecs built their capitol in the center of a lake, accessible only by narrow, and easily defensible, causeways.  By the first millennium BC, many cities, most notably Greek and Roman cities, employed walls comprised of thick stones and bricks.  Gates and guardtowers could regulate traffic in and out of a city, and the walls compelled hostile forces to employ costly siege weapons in order to overtake a city.

Throughout the 1940s, 50s and 60s, several public and private organizations endeavored to create computers for the purposes of solving mathematical problems.  Some of the earliest computers, including the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), were designed to deal with very specific problems.  Later models, such as the UNIVAC (Universal Numerical Integrator and Computer) were more programmable, and, hence, more versatile, enabling users to give the computer instructions for solving more than one problem.  Companies like International Business Machines (IBM) developed large "mainframe" systems in which multiple users could share time on a single computer system.  The invention of the transistor in 1948 introduced a more reliable, more efficient semiconductor device that eventually replaced the vacuum tube a decade later.  Soon, major research laboratories employed mainframes in their research.

Correctional Facilities serve as holding pens for convicted criminals, as well as a deterrent against future crimes.  Incarceration is one of the more effective criminal deterrents, as conditions in prison systems are almost always utterly deplorable.
[END]

[IMPROVE_CORRECTIONAL_FACILITY_HISTORICAL]
Before the proliferation of prison systems, the chief means of punishing serious offenders were corporal punishment, execution and banishment.  Until the late 18th century, prisons were mainly for the confinement of debtors, the accused awaiting trial and convicts awaiting sentencing.  Gradually, prisons became a more accepted method of punishment, and an emphasis on rehabilitation, reformation and correction started to emerge.  Various philosophies as to proper methods of rehabilitation abounded throughout the 19th century.  The reformatory system of late 19th century America emphasized vocational training, indeterminate sentences and rewards for good behavior and parole.  This model for the modern correctional facility prevailed in the American criminal justice system of the 20th century.

Incarceration has always been seen as an effective form of punishment.  The threat of prison acted as a deterrent to potential criminals, and the long-term removal of convicted offenders from society protected people as a whole.  Perhaps most important, the controlled environment of prison offered opportunities for reforming criminals through such things as counseling, education and vocational training.  Unfortunately, the reality of the modern correctional facility system was that often, criminals would engage in criminal activity within the confines of their prisons, and the social and economic costs of incarceration were staggeringly high.

[END]

[IMPROVE_COURTHOUSE_HISTORICAL]
The evolution of the Roman legal system was indicative of how fledgling nations developed their legal systems to accomodate ever increasing levels of complexity in laws and codes.  The earliest attempts to establish Roman law was attempted with the Twelve Tables in 451-450 BC.  They made available the rules and procedures for many civil, public, criminal and sacred laws, the minutiae of which were previously controlled and executed by a small group of pontiffs (pontifices), members of the patrician ruling class.  Posted in the Roman Forum, it became a public property and, therefore, appealable by any Roman citizen.

Roman law, and the Roman courts, primarily concerned themselves with matters of property and possessions (right over land and slaves), obligations (contracts and loans), succession (inheritance and family law) and persons (citizenship, family and slaves).  However, when Rome was first founded and insignificant to much of the Mediterranean world, laws only applied to Roman citizens.  A foreigner (perigrinus) had no rights whatsoever within Roman land, unless his state had entered into a formal agreement with Rome.  By the middle of the 3rd century BC, Rome began to grow in power.  To extend legal protections to the growing number of peregrini, the Roman Empire developed the jus gentium ("law of the nations") to govern activity between cives (citizens) and peregrini.

The rise of the role of courts in lawmaking and legal enforcement grew as the Roman legal system evolved.  The first stage of development, the legis actiones, took place during the Twelve Tables period from 5th century BC to the last 2nd century BC.  Legal procedure was divided into several steps.  Initially, the plaintiffs approached defendants in public places and requested they come to court.  Those who refused could be taken by force.  The trial consisted of a preliminary hearing, held before a magistrate, who determined whether there was a grievance and, if so, what it was.  After the issues were brought to light, both parties would agree on a iudex (judge), a prominent citizen who was not of a legal profession.  Proceedings before a iudex were less formal:  advocates spoke, presented evidence and called witnesses.  Although the iudex made a decision, he had no power to execute it.  If found in the wrong, the defendant was given a specific period in which to redress the grievance.  Failure to comply could result in the defendant being brought before the magistrate by force.  His property could be seized, or he could be made a slave to the plaintiff to work off the debt or claim.

In the later Republic period, as cases became more complex, the issues presented to the iudex had to be written down.  This lead to the formulary system, in which the procedure of defendants brought to court remained, byt with a more powerful role for the magistrate in determining whether a case went to the iudex.  After the classical period ended in the late 3rd century AD, the cognitio extraordinaria system saw a further increase of power placed in the hands of magistrates and the courts.  Courts began issuing summons, trial rulings were documented and magistrates eventually supplanted iudices in the role of judge.  After Christianity became the state religion of Rome, the ecclesiastical courts, previously established by Christians who had refused to have recourse to pagan courts, became a part of the Roman legal system. As the Roman Empire disintegrated, the ecclesiastical courts survived and assumed jurisdiction over secular affairs.

[IMPROVE_DRUG_STORE_HISTORICAL]
The modern pharmacy, known colloquially as a drug store, became strikingly different from the apothecaries of the 17th and 18th centuries.  Whereas pharmacists of that era dealt in the elixirs, spirits, salves and powders outlined in the Pharmacopoeiae of London (1618) and Paris (1639), modern pharmacists dealt with complex remedies and medicines, selected for their therapeutic value and reviewed by commitees of doctors and medical experts.  The Pharmacopoeia of the United States, first published in 1820, reviewed submissions by panel consisting of the U.S. Surgeon General and representatives from colleges of medicine and pharmacology, as well as state medical and pharmaceutical associations.

In 1841, the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was founded, with intent to give pharmacists in a thoroughly scientific basis.  As pharmacology became more of a scientific pursuit, new, more powerful drugs became available.  Although physicians could only administer the most powerful drugs, pharmacists could prepare and dispense treatments both prescribed by a physician and those deemed acceptable for non-prescription use.  These "over-the-counter" drugs usually consisted of the most common treatments for the most common ailments.

As the power and speed of microprocessors increased in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, crackers were finding it easier to crack complex encryption schemes.

In response, businesses and government entities sunk millions of dollars into cryptography schemes that could guarantee the security of sensitive information over the Internet, such as financial transactions, medical records and government documents.  Employing an evolving asymmetric encryption scheme, the major financial institutions began to establish electronic banks in which money could be stored with little to no risk of theft.  Customers used cards encoded with their financial information to transact business both in person and online.  Although the malicious intrusions of crackers kept system administrators busy, the new e-bank system increased the safety and efficiency of commerce.

[IMPROVE_ECO_TRANSIT_HISTORICAL]
The folly of the 20th century world's reliance on fossil fuels began to manifest itself in even greater problems than people had originally envisioned.  Many nations who had come to rely almost entirely on fossil fuels for their energy requirements were beholden to the whims of a greedy cartel of major oil-producing countries.  In light of this as well as the dwindling supply of fossil fuels worldwide, scientists scurried to develop alternate fuel sources.  Solar energy required vast stretches of uninhabited land in order to produce enough energy to supplant conventional power plants, and solar cells were highly toxic and difficult to dispose of when damaged.  The transportation and automobile industries, both major contributers to global pollution due to their reliance on internal combustion engines, were prime candidates for the development of an alternate power source.  Late 20th century experiments with battery-powered electric cars were hampered by the limited capacity of conventional batteries.  Electric car users had to recharge batteries at a rate considerably higher than conventional car users need to fill their tanks with gasoline.  Some auto manufacturers even employed electric battery-combustion engine hybrids, which reduced, but did not eliminate harmful greenhouse gas emissions.

Fuel cells, many of which derived power from the processing of non-petroleum-based organic sources, were the answer to the inefficiency of standard batteries.  Portable and reasonably inexpensive, fuel cells contained vastly more energy than rechargeable batteries and they produced little more than water as a by-product.  Now that automobiles outfitted with fuel cells could perform as well or better than conventional cars, an increasingly ecology-conscious world considered them superior vehicles.  Since pollution in cities had reached alarming heights, citizens began to clamor for clean, fuel-cell-equipped public transit systems.  As Eco-Transit spread in personal and public transportation, pollution levels the world over grew at a vastly decreased level.

[IMPROVE_FACTORY_HISTORICAL]
One of the most profound and far reaching developments brought about by the Industrial Revolutions in Western Europe over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries was the factory system.  Whereas manufactured goods were the domain of craftsmen and artisans before the Industrial Revolution, a distributed labor system, coupled with the invention of such devices as the spinning jenny and the power loom enabled a more expansive production of goods, such as textiles, with a minimum of human effort.  The American inventor Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, a device that mechanically removed cotton fibers from the seed, in 1793.  In 1801, French inventor Joseph Jacquard created a loom that employed cards with punched holes to automate the placement of threads in the weaving process.

Eli Whitney also introduced the concept of interchangeable parts to the factory system in 1798.  Because repairs and assembly could be done with previously manufactured parts rather than custom made ones, interchangeable parts made it possible to produce goods quicker and cheaper.  This idea led to the development of the assembly line and the manufacturing of products in discrete stages.  Developments in steam power and, later, the internal combustion engine freed factories up from the needs for water-sourced based power, such as mills, and led to an explosion of manufacturing power that ushered in the modern age.

The term "flak" was an abbreviated name for Fliegerabwehrkanone, the 88-millimeter German-made antiaircraft cannon that was the bane of allied bombers in World War II.  While most rapid-firing antiaircraft guns employed much smaller shells, like the 40-millimeter "Bofors guns" preferred by Allied forces against dive-bombers and low-flying aircraft.  Flak cannons, some up to 120 mm, were particularly effective against high-flying, slow-moving bombers.  The shells, fired up to 2 miles in the air at rates as high as 120 rounds a minute, used radio-waved proximity fuses that would explode within a certain range of the target.  Despite continued developments in the early 1950s, flak cannons and other heavy antiaircraft guns were eventually replaced by surface-to-air missiles in the late 1950s and early '60s.

Food silos took many forms, from towering grain silos to insulated warehouses that housed perishable items such as cheese or fruit.  Some food silos controlled the atmospheric gases contained within, in an attempt to extend the storage life of foods.  Others employed refrigeration and freezing to preserve the freshness, consistency and texture of highly perishable items.  All of these methods helped to minimize waste, prevent food-borne diseases and better equip cities and communities to survive occasional food shortages.

The rapid development of weapons and vehicle technology throughout the modern and genetic ages brought conventional warfare to dangerous new levels.  Cities were ill equipped to defend themselves against newer, more advanced assault craft.  Whereas city walls, ballista towers and battlements were suitable for 19th century combat, they often provided little more than an obstacle to a post-modern offensive army.  With the development of chaos theory and the explosion in new understanding about the nature of chaotic systems, scientists began to design theoretical models that mimicked the "forcefields" spoken of in countless science fiction books.  Not until researchers discovered the unified theory of everything did forcefield development moved from theory to reality.  Scientists developed a massive dome-shaped layer of an extremely stable form of carbon called carbon-60 "buckyballs."  When the forcefield detected high mass or energy (akin to a projectile or energy beam weapon) it solidified, linking carbon to carbon in a solid shield with the hardness and resiliency of pure diamond.  The first cities to employ this technology were able to withstand substantial attacks from hover infantry, tanks and cruise missiles.  Finally, city defense technology had risen to the level of offensive warfare technology.

In 1998, construction on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, began.  It was designed to generate 1.5 billion watts of fusion power continuously.  The $10 billion experiment, a partnership between the European Union, Japan, Russia and the United States, was declared a success in 2009.  Although it provided substantial insight into fusion technology, commercial fusion reactors did not become a reality until late in the 21st century.  Advances in nano-assembly, chaos theory and high temperature superconductors made safe, effective fusion reactors possible.

Fusion became the most environmentally clean power source the world had known.  It generated no pollutants, greenhouse gases and a fraction of the radioactivity that fission-reaction nuclear power plants did.  Fusion reactors were much safer, with no serious threat from control system failures.  Unlike a fission reactor, which could catastrophically meltdown in the case of a systems failure, fusion reactors merely cooled off - the plasma cooled and reactions ceased.  The abundance of deuterium in the world's oceans combined with the ability to breed tritium within the reactor itself meant that fusion reactors were a virtually inexhaustible supply of energy.

They often contained compartments, as well as pots and urns used to store food surplusses.  They were a crucial step in enabling people to settle land and expand their civilizations.  With proper food storage techniques, societies could cope with the unpredictability of weather, soil and natural forces.

In the 1850s and 60s, hospitals were overcrowded, poorly ventilated, inadequately cleaned places.  Hospital care was considerably more dangerous to peoples' health than home care, and as many as 25 percent of patients died after surgery due to poor sanitation.  However, in 1865, British surgeon Joseph Lister introduced sanitation techniques that vastly increased the safety of hospitalization.  The care of the patient improved with the introduction of formal nurses training schools.  The first U.S. nursing schools were founded independently in 1873 by New York's Bellevue Hospital, Boston's General Hospital and the New Haven Hospital in Connecticutt.  The development of X rays and the clinical laboratory in the 1890s further improved the quality of care available to patients and prompted the opening of many new hospitals, including religious hospitals and hospitals that specialized in the treatment of women or children. The number of for-profit hospitals owned by doctors also increased between 1890 and 1920.

From the 5th to the 10th centuries, the use of waterwheel mills dramatically increased in Middle Ages-era Europe.

By the 11th and 12th centuries, the waterwheel technology had spread to the textiles industry, powering great looms.  Waterwheels provided a clean source of power, and enabled larger scale production operations for the processing of materials, such as grains in grist mills and wool and cotton in looms.  Mills remained in service well into the 1800s, and were particularly popular in regions of the United States where coal was scarce and wood was considered an unsatisfactory fuel source.  Throughout the Northeast and Midwest, mills contributed to the industrialization of many of the modern era's most productive and prominent cities.

[END]

[IMPROVE_MOVIE_PALACE_HISTORICAL]
The lavish motion picture palaces of the early 20th century, which later spawned the massive, multi-screen movie theaters of the late 20th century were themselves borne of the live theaters and music halls of fin-de-siecle urban America.  The earliest films were not originally shown in movie palaces.  Rather, they were shown on Kinetoscope machines that permitted only one viewer at a time.  Existing entertainment venues, such as penny arcades, installed rows of these machines and enticed patrons to view these new technological creations.  Because Kinetoscopes were little more than optical illusions, people tended to regard them as curiosities.  The earliest films were marketed based not on stars, titles or subjects but the projection machinery involved.  Tally's Electric Theater, the first building devoted entirely to movies, was built in Los Angeles in 1902.  Even though the mass relocation of East Coast filmmakers that birthed the Hollywood movie industry had yet to happen until the end of the decade, movies were popular enough to urge businessmen to invest in storefront theaters and "nickelodeons."  These new theaters employed new projection technology that, unlike the Kinetoscopes, enabled multiple patrons to view a film projected on a screen.  Nickelodeons garnered a sordid reputation and rankled upper class citizens, who prefered the "respectable" theaters that showed operas, plays and vaudeville.

Films began to catch the attention of upper class audiences when "big-time" vaudeville operators began including them on the bill.  When Adolph Zukor showed the film Queen Elizabeth at the Lyceum Theaterin New York in 1912, audiences enjoyed the dramatic, stage-like presentation of the subject matter, and, particularly, the appearance of Sarah Bernhardt, a noted stage actor, in the title role.  Filmmakers began to produce movies consisting of little more than filmed productions of staged theater in an attempt to improve the industry's image.  The first feature length films, including D.W. Griffith's twelve-reel Birth of a Nation in 1915, transformed movies into narrative vehicles, rather than mere technological curiosities.  

The vaudeville houses of the same period fused highbrow and popular cultural influences in their architecture and decor.  Patrons entered though lavish, often oriental-themed facades festooned with flashing lights and marquees into marble-floored, mirrored-wall foyers, decked out with oil paintings, plush furniture and smartly dressed personal attendants.  They attempted to mimic the grandeur of New York's opera houses, and offered extra amenities.  Proctor's Pleasure Palace, built in 1895, offered a roof garden restaurant, library, barbershop, and a turkish bath housed in a Romanesque facade.  As films gained prominence and legitimacy, movie palaces sought to provide the same experience as the best vaudeville houses.  The Regent, American's first motion picture palace, opened in New York in 1913.  Although it was located in a working class district, uptown from the legitimate theater district, its opening night audience consisted of many of the same patrons of New York's toniest opera houses and theaters.  Movie palaces, such as the Strand, the Rialto and the Rivoli, soon took their place along legitimate theaters on Broadway.

Samuel L. Rothapfel, also known as "Roxy," was, more than anyone else, responsible for the increasing opulence of these movie houses.  He presided over the openings of many movie palaces, and instituted practices distinct from traditional theaters, namely, unreserved seating and low admission prices.  What perhaps contributed to the success and allure of movie palaces was that they were designed to make the average citizen feel like royalty.  Movie palaces gave people an opportunity to step into a world of fantasy and, for the pioneers of the movie industry, many of whom were first generation Americans, this was the fulfillment of the American dream.

Complex objects, such as electrical appliances, could be constructed as well.  Later applications of nano-assembly allowed for the manufacture of objects of unorthodox construction, such as sheets of flawless diamond.  Nanite construction and nano-assembly revolutionized the manufacturing industry, rendering robotic plants obsolete.

[END]

[IMPROVE_NUCLEAR_PLANT_HISTORICAL]
In 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission.  By bombarding uranium with neutrons in an attempt to create elements heavier than uranium, they unwittingly induced a fission reaction.  When a particle such as a neuron hit the nucleus of a uranium atom, it caused it to split into two fission fragments of roughly the same atomic composition.  This process released a large amount of thermal energy, as well as gamma rays and a few free neutrons, which in turn fissioned other uranium nuclei.  This series of fissions constituted a chain reaction, which yielded a constant supply of nuclear energy.  If these reactions could be controlled, scientists theorized, then one would have a supply of energy much cleaner than conventional oil, gas and coal-burning power plants.  In the late 1950s an early '60s, a few commercial nuclear power plants were built.  The most successful of these used water as a cooling system for reactors.  The demand for nuclear plants skyrocketed in the mid-1960s and early '70s but dropped off in the later part of the decade, due to a decline in need, coupled with public fears about the danger of nuclear meltdown.

In a nuclear reactor, the chain reaction produced a tremendous amount of radiation and thermal energy.  Some of the thermal energy was used to heat water and create steam.  The steam drove a turbine, and the turbine's mechanical energy was converted to energy by means of a generator.  Despite the relative cleanliness of nuclear power, nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1979 and at Chernobyl, Soviet Union in 1986 became iconic reminders of the catastrophic power of uncontrolled fission reactions.  Despite these incidents, nuclear plants continued to operate in Europe, Japan and various other countries for many years.

As the advancement of science in the 21st century continued to gain momentum, researchers began to bump up against the limitations of the world - atmospheric conditions, environmental regulations and the omnipresence of gravity.  Seeking a research facility in which they could conduct experiments with no regard for these considerations, scientists looked to the stars.  In 2037, a privately funded research group headed by the noted physicist Richard Myers launched the first operational orbital laboratory into space.  The small research team aboard the craft was now able to conduct experiments in pursuit of breakthroughs in chaos theory and unified field theory.  The laboratory was expensive to build and maintain.  An advanced composite structure kept it lightweight and free from degradation.  Fuel cells powered the huge reactors and battery of diagnostic equipment at the scientists' disposal.  Soon, several cities began launching their own satellites and prompting a worldwide boost in scientific research.

[END]

[IMPROVE_PUBLIC_TRANSPORTATION_HISTORICAL]
The first modern public transportation systems date back to 16th and 17th century Europe, where horse-drawn carriages offered for-hire transportation between major towns.  Carriage systems existed in large cities as well, eventually replaced in the 19th century by stagecoaches and, later, omnibuses.  In 1832, New York City introduced horse-drawn streetcars that ran on iron rails rather than wagon wheels.  Rails reduced friction, making it easier for horses to pull the rail cars.  By the 1860s, most U.S. cities had horse- or mule-powered street franchised by the city.  Andrew Hallidie invented the cable car, of which the first successful system was opened in San Francisco in 1873.  Its propulsion system relied on cables running the length of the tracks rather than waste-producing, disease-prone horses.  More than 30 cities employed similar systems, which were later replaced by electric streetcar systems.

In 1888, electric power revolutionized urban public transportation with the completion of the first electrified streetcar line in Richmond, Virginia.  Subway systems were also popular with London, England, Boston, Massachusetts and New York City all opening electric subways systems around the turn of the century.  Modern cities the world over employed a combination of subways, light rail and bus systems to shuttle large groups of people around quickly and cheaply.  Public transit systems were more prevalent in older cities, because these cities established public transportation well before automobile use was common.  Population density played a role as well.  Higher density cities needed public transportation more, especially one with major business districts.

Well-implemented public transit produced enormous benefits for communities:  improved air-quality, less land consumption, lower energy requirements and lower accident costs.  Because many people are carried in the same vehicle, transportation takes up less space and energy than automobile-based systems.  Busses, which are the backbone of many city transit systems, have lower accident rates than autos, mainly due to their operation by professional drivers.  Subway and light rail systems are safer and more cost-effective by far than autos or buses.

[IMPROVE_PUBLISHING_HOUSE_HISTORICAL]
Before the invention of writing, most likely by the Sumerians in the fourth millenium BC, people could only spread information by word of mouth.  Writing was originally considered a way of recording socially and economically vital information, such as genealogical tables, codes of law and religious texts, rather than a vehicle for information dissemination.  Because writing was seen as an act of recording, not distributing, information in ancient times, only nontheocratic societies, such as Rome and China, had any semblance of publishing beyond letters and scripts, that is, a copying industry for the purpose of supplying a non-religious readership.

With the invention of printing in 6th century AD China, and later improvements in moveable type in the 11th century, the written word, and its possibilities, evolved.  Johannes Gutenberg's printing press brought Europe into the fold of modern printing techniques in the mid-15th century.  Although one of the chief uses of printing was rapid and inexpensive publishing of religious materials, publishing found its uses in the academic world as well, and, in fact, was one of the critical developments that brought Europe out of the Dark Ages and into the Renaissance.  It contributed to a steady rise in literacy for the middle class and the expanded intellectual pursuits for the next 500 years.  The publishing industry was slow to grow, but demand for mass-produced, secular texts in philosophy, science and politics increased.  Freedom of the press was, for the most part, established in Europe and North America by the 18th century as most attempts to regulate this mode of communication by forces who deemed it dangerous had been defeated.  More than anything else, the prevalence of both publicly- and privately-owned publishing houses freed the written word from its mostly religious role and contributed to an explosion of education, literacy and intellectual development.

[END]

[IMPROVE_RECYCLING_PLANT_HISTORICAL]
Although waste had always been a problem in human societies, the population growth of the 20th century compounded this problem enormously. To meet this challenge, governments and private organizations began programs to reduce the flow of waste products into landfills and incinerators by paying citizens a nominal amount of money to recycle products such as glass, plastic, or aluminum.  Cities and municipalities opened recycling centers to facilitate collection, the product of which went to recycling plants.  A culture of reusability pervaded many industries, and recyclable materials eventually included iron and steel scrap, aluminum, glass, paper, wood and plastics. 

Contrary to prevailing belief at the time, recycling took hold in modern, affluent societies not because it was an environmentally responsible thing to do, but because it was economically advantageous for large-scale manufacturing operations.  The cost of recycling certain materials was less than the cost of processing new raw materials.  Nevertheless, widespread recycling efforts diminished human impact on the ecology in three distinct ways: it reduced manufacturers' needs for finite natural resources, such as petroleum, trees, mineral ores, and coal, it helped reduce the volume of solid waste in landfills, which had become increasingly expensive, and it reduced the pollution of air, water and land resulting from waste disposal.

[IMPROVE_ANTI_BALLISTIC_MISSILES_HISTORICAL]
Although late 20th-century politicians and military theorists envisioned a large-scall satellite-driven early warning and defensive engagement system for the prevention of nuclear ballistic missileattacks, such systems failed to gain widespread support from the public.  In addition, technical problems, cost prohibitions and an increasingly hostile diplomatic climate forced many of these visionaries to shelve their dreams.  Scientists instead opted for a distributed system, devoid of central control, that could enable a nation to concentrate anti-ballistic missile defenses around strategic cities and other sites, such as ICBM silos.  The system employed both satellite- and ground-based beam weapon systems to intercept incoming missiles in combination with sophisticated electronic countermeasures designed to scramble missile targeting systems.  Radar, optical and infrared detection systems formed the front line of defense and remotely coordinated the interception systems.

Public officials and social critics argued vehemently against such defense systems.  However, the decline in control over the distribution of nuclear weapons technology raised the spectre nuclear missile attacks not from established nations like the Soviet Union, the United States or India but from extremists and terrorists.  Public opinion in favor of anti-ballistic missile systems eventually prevailed, and many cities began to adopt the defensive technology to protect themselves against an increasingly hostile and unpredictable world.

[IMPROVE_SECURITY_MONITOR_HISTORICAL]
Advancements in video technology, computer systems and artificial intelligence proliferated in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  The prevalence of private security systems in homes, businesses and institutions was not a new phenomenon.  However, in response to an increasingly strident public outcry at rising crime rates, many cities began to install security systems in public places.  These new systems employed sophisticated AI protocols to monitor activity and process any abnormalities.  At first, law enforcement efforts found the new AI surveillance systems a boon to their operations.  Crime rates dropped, due to enhanced criminal identification and apprehension efforts.

Some law enforcement advocates began to speculate on the potential uses for AI surveillance in private areas as well.  They pointed to their successes on the streets as proof of the system's worth and pressed law-makers to relax privacy laws in order to enable building owners to install surveillance systems in their buildings to monitor tenants.  What had become a positive solution to the problem of public-area crime became a nightmarish violation of privacy, as government and law enforcement now had the power to monitor people in their own homes.  The same public that demanded surveillance systems on the streets now found cameras in their homes.  Crime continued to drop, as people no longer had a place to hide their illicit activities.  But the constant invasion of privacy, once a right guaranteed by many civilized nations, had created an embittered and outraged public.

Shrines had as many forms and functions as the religions that employed them.  They also were referred to by many different names:  Church, Synagogue, Temple, and Mosques.  Depending on the faith, shrines functioned as places to worship in groups or alone, house relics or mark a spiritually significant location.  Some shrines were simple structures, little more than a roof over sacred relics and prayer flags.  Others were elaborate monuments, like the pyramids of Egypt, which served primarily to house the tombs of kings.  Often, religious centers were the center of a town or region, and often represented the zenith of a culture's craftsmanship and architectural skill.

[IMPROVE_TELEVISION_HISTORICAL]
Although radio was a primary source of news and entertainment for much of the civilized world, the television became the overwhelmingly dominant medium in the late 20th century.  The first two decades of the 20th century saw developments in picture tube technology, methods of amplifying electronic signals and the theoretical formulation of the electronic-scanning principle.  These advancements later became the basis of the modern television.  In 1932, the Radio Corporation of America employed a camera tube called an iconoscope and a cathode-ray tube in the receiver of one of the first all-electronic televisions.  By the 1950s, there were separate color and black-and-white signals broadcast.  Televisions became a standard fixture in the living rooms of America, supplanting radio as the dominant source of entertainment.  By the 1960s, television had reached many other nations and, by the end of the 20th century had impacted virtually every aspect of the societies in which it was used, from politics and culture to art and entertainment.

[IMPROVE_THEATER_HISTORICAL]
The word "theater" derived from the Greek word "theaomai," meaning "to see."  Traditionally, Greek dramas were performed in an outdoor setting comprised of three zones:  the orchestra, a large circular dancing floor on which the action took place, the skene (from whence the word "scene" came from) behind this, where actors dressed and built scenes, and a low architectural facade upon which painted scenery could be attached.  Seating for spectators formed a semi-circle around the orchestra.  It was usually cut into a hillside and featured wooden benches, and, later, stone or marble seats.  The steep layout of some auditoriums enabled as much as 10,000 to 20,000 people to sit reasonably close to the action on stage, as well as enhanced acoustics.  Some theaters employed periaktoi, or revolving panels, to quickly change scenery, as well as a mechane, or crane, which served to fly in the gods (deus ex machina) to provide closure at the end of a tragic play.

[IMPROVE_UNIVERSITY_HISTORICAL]
Although initially designed as facilities for training clergymen, universities opened their doors to secular study and emerged as centers of higher learning.  Universities specializing in law and medicine existed in France and Italy as early as 1100 AD.  With a highly educated ruling class, people engaged each other in higher-level pursuits, such as philosophy, theology and law.  The classical Greek and Roman schools, with their emphasis on rhetoric and critical thinking, produced exceptional writers, philosophers and statesmen.  It was the intellectual environment of these times that intrigued thinkers of the 15th and 16th centuries, prompting the Renaissance obsession with classical art, education, politics and culture.

Fantasies come to life, dreams are fulfilled and this makes people extremely happy.
[END]

[IMPROVE_VR_AMUSEMENT_PARK_HISTORICAL]
The two main forms of twentieth century entertainment were film and television.  Their impact on human society continued to be analyzed and quantified long after their novelty wore off.  In the 1980s, however, media experts began to speculate on the death of TV and movies at the hands of an emerging technological medium with far-reaching entertainment potential, called "virtual reality."  This technology faded from public consciousness in lieu of any compelling applications, however, and TV and movies continued to claim the majority share of the public's entertainment quotient.  Amusement parks began to incorporate more technology in their attractions, combining the power of moving traditional animatronics and detailed environments with moving pictures, compelling sound, pyrotechnics and dynamic lighting.  However, these attractions could only produce so much verisimilitude.  The limited interactivity of traditional attraction technology mitigated their depth of immersion.  Thrill rides could only follow one path, live action sequences were often scripted and safety considerations limited the possible actions guests could take within environments.

The explosion in computer hardware technology in the late 1990s and early 2000s refocused attention of creating a virtual reality environment, in which patrons could exist and interact in a realistic physical space.  However, developments in neural interfaces shifted the focus of virtual reality and immersion entertainment from highly detailed physical environments to ultra-realistic "mental" environments.  The first neural interface VR machines employed high-resolution liquid crystal display eyepieces, standard headphones and an array of electrodes on the subject's scalp.  The eyepieces broadcast images, synchronized with sounds, and the electrodes monitored brain activity to trigger environmental elements and "read" the subject's impulses, translating them into actions within the environment.  As neural interfaces evolved, virtual reality devices simply tapped into the nervous system itself.  Instead of displaying images to the ocular receptors of the eye, they piped data, translated into neurochemical impulses into the part of the brain that interpreted visual data.  The same theory applied to aural stimuli as well.  To complete the circle of interactivity, the neural interface monitored sectors of the brain, including emotions, motor skills and thought processes, to gauge the user's actions within the synthesized environment.
The first Virtual Reality "Amusement Park" opened in Berlin in 2027.  Guests donned neural interfaces and sat comfortably in anechoic chambers, transporting their consciousness to another reality.  VR Amusement Parks began to supplant more traditional entertainment media, leading motion picture and television studios to switch to producing VR sims instead of traditional films.  Citizens, once delighted and mesmerized by movie screens soon found the superior experience in being a part of the movie itself.  The worlds of cinema, theme parks and computer games had intersected, revolutionizing entertainment forever.

[UNIT_AIRCRAFT_CARRIER_HISTORICAL]
The origins of the modern aircraft carrier date back to 1910, when an American civilian pilot, Eugene Ely, flew a plane off a specially built platform attached to the deck of the U.S. cruiser Birmingham at Hampton Roads, Virginia.  Ely then performed the first carrier landing, on the quarterdeck of the battleship Pennsylvania, in San Francisco, California on January 18, 1911.  By using wires attached to sandbags, he was able to stop his plane quickly.  The British, Japanese and U.S. navies began to develop the first true carriers with unobstructed flight decks but the war ended before they could see battle.  The aircraft carrier came of age in World War II as they began to prove themselves more versatile, effective and destructive than battleships and battle cruisers for naval combat.

In the beginning of World War II, planes dive-bombing and torpedo bombing from carriers did not have enough velocity or destructive power to penetrate battleship armor.  By the end of the war, advances in aircraft and weapons technology finally gave carrier-based planes the power they needed to sink even the largest Yamato-class battleships of the Japanese fleet.  The long reign of the battleship ended when U.S. carrier-based planes sunk the Musashi in October 1944 and the Yamato in 1945.  Carriers continued to be the most formidable ship in the world for well into the 21st century.

[UNIT_ARCHER_HISTORICAL]
Though no single civilization can lay claim to its invention, origins of archery can be traced back at least 40,000 years.  The earliest bows consisted of a thin length of wood fastened with string or sinew at each end.  Later, bows were made of several materials, including wood and horn glued together and reinforced with bands of sinew.  The English longbow, made of wood from the yew tree, was famous in battle, helping win battles over the French at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt during the Hundred Years' War.  Other cultures employed the bow in war, hunting and recreational archery, including the Egyptians, Assyrians, Chinese, Goths and Mongols.  Accounts of Renaissance-era European travelers indicate that the bow and arrow was the weapon of choice on virtually every continent.

Artillery was a fearsome development in the early 20th century battlefield.  Artillery guns replaced cannons as the preferred heavy weapon that shot explosive shells over considerable distances.  Over the first decades of the 20th century, artillery evolved as a devastatingly effective anti-personnel weapon.  In the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, artillery accounted for ten percent of casualties.  By World War I, that number rose to seventy percent.  It was not a flawless weapon, however.  It was relatively easy to fortify buildings and installations to sufficiently defend against artillery fire.

[UNIT_BATTLESHIP_HISTORICAL]
The high seas of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the setting for the swift advance of naval tactics and warfare.  Navies abandoned the wooden-hulls and sails of ships-of-the-line in favor of engine powered, metal-hulled battleships and cruisers. Combining large size, powerful guns, and heavy armor with speed, strength and range, battleships were the unrivaled capital ships of the world's navies for nearly a century after they were first introduced in 1860.  

World War II was the battleship's heyday, when the Washington Treaty of 1922, which limited battleship sizes to 35,000 tons of displacement, was abandoned.  The United States, Germany and Japan built 45,000-ton Iowa class, 52,600-ton Bismarck class and 72,000-ton Yamato class battleships, respectively.  They employed antiaircraft weapons, 5-inch caliber rapid-fire guns and a multitude of 20 to 40 mm automatic weapons.  They could travel great distances at the relatively high speed of over 30 knots.  This period of dominance came to a swift end, however, with the rapid development of the aircraft carrier, the range and striking power of which relegated the battleship to coastal bombardment and carrier escort duties.  The United States continued to employ World War II-era battleships in the latter 20th century, finally retiring the Wisconsin and the Missouri, the two remaining Iowa-class ships, after service in the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s.

As gunpowder revolutionized the world of infantry and melee combat in the 16th century, it revolutionized siege weapons in the mid 1300s.  Although the earliest "bombards" were unwieldy, unreliable and relatively weak siege weapons, improvements in metallurgy in the next two centuries dramatically increased the quality of smelted iron and bronze.  By the beginning of the 16th century, iron cannon, cast in blast furnaces, began to improve.  Cannons accompanied by infantry and cavalry replaced catapults, pikemen and knights on the battlefields of Europe and Asia.  Ships also capitalized on the emerging cannon technology to intensify naval combat.

[UNIT_CARAVAN_HISTORICAL]
In ancient times, merchants, pilgrims and travelers often journeyed together in deserts and hostile regions for mutual protection.  In the deserts of northern Africa and Asia, camels were the most common animal used in caravans, due to its broad appetite, its ability to go without water for several days and its load capacity.  Although camels were harnessed to carts in the tea trade between China and Mongolia, they often carried their loads split in two equal parts and fastened to their backs.  In hot weather or on long journeys, camels typically carried 350 pounds.  On shorter journeys, in cooler climes and in order to evade customs duties, camels often carried as much as 1,000 pounds.

Caravan sizes varied depending on the amount of traffic on the route, the relative safety of the route and the availability of camels.  The largest caravans ever recorded were for special purposes, such as Muslim pilgrimages to Mecca that included over 10,000 camels, or the salt caravans that traversed the Sahara from Taodenni to Timbuktu, which numbered 20,000 camels.  Camels were fastened together with rope passed through nose rings and tied to the saddle, in lines of up to 40 camels.  As many as four strings would travel abreast or the whole caravan traveled in a single-file line.

The timelines of caravan operations depended on the availability of water and food, as well as seasonal considerations.  The Orenburg caravan left Bukhara after the winter snows of Russia melted, and the Basra caravan left Alepo after the rains of late autumn in the Middle East.  A caravan averaged 2 to 3 miles per hour for up to 14 hours a day.  Some locations along well-traveled routes had caravansaries, which had stables and rooms for rest.

Eventually, the increase in sea trade contributed to the decline of many of the major routes (such as the Silk Road from China to the Mediterranean).  Many caravans continued to operate until the 19th century, when rail transport and the abolition of the slave trade spelled the end for the centuries-old form of transport and travel.

[UNIT_CARRACK_HISTORICAL]
One of the most popular and versatile ships of late 15th and early 16th century Europe, the carrack was ideal for both trade and warfare.  
Initially designed as a two-mast ship, shipbuilders eventually added a third mast to accommodate more sails.  This enabled the carrack to meet the load and speed requirements that the increasing scale, frequency and range of international trade demanded.  As designers added multiple masts, they also elongated the hull; keels were often two and a half times as long as the ship's beam (width).  The hull, which consisted of large, caulked planks laid end to end against a frame, distinguished the carrack from clinker-style ships with hulls of overlapping planks.  Weighing between 700 to 1000 tons, Carracks were two to three times heavier than their early 15th-century predecessors.

Carracks' high sides made them easily defensible. They could be adapted to carry troops or horses, and they could withstand attacks well. 
Two of the most famous Carracks were the Santa Maria, one of Christopher Columbus' legendary fleet of ships, and the Mary Rose.  Built in 1510 at the order of King Henry VIII of England, the 105-foot battle carrack carried cannons fired out of gun ports cut into the sides of the ship.  However, gun ports were a vulnerability for the Mary Rose and similarly designed carracks.  When the ship listed to the side, water could pour in and sink it.  Historians speculate that the Mary Rose, which sank in 1545, most likely met this fate.  Regardless of this, the carrack served both trade functions and war duties admirably.

Although their light build made them unfit to survive as archaeological finds, evidence of skin boat and coracle use can be found in the iconographic representations of rock carvings at Kalnes and Gjerpen in Norway.  Historians believe that skin boats like the coracle did not lead to significant steps in the evolution of boat construction, and more settled societies opted for more durable, timber-based boats for intercontinental exploration and conquest.

[UNIT_CATAPULT_HISTORICAL]
The catapult was the one of the most effective siege weapons used in ancient and medieval warfare.  Although many siege weapons, including ballistae, magonels and trebuchets, fall under the general heading catapult, the term almost always refers to a mounted, single long arm of wood which hurled stones and other objects.  They operated by a sudden release of tension on wooden beams or twisted cords of fibers, usually, gut, sinew or horsehair.  Their primary use was attacking fortresses or cities.  By hurling large rocks, flaming balls or groups of small stones, catapults could severely damage walls, ignite fires and devastate closely ranked foot soldiers and cavalry.  Some catapults were permanently mounted in fortresses and used for defense, while others were set on a wheeled cart for easy transport and positional change.  The introduction of the gunpowder cannon in the 14th century spelled the end of the catapult's use in warfare.

[UNIT_CLERIC_HISTORICAL]
The cleric was a kind of religious crusader that flourished during the middle ages.  Many types of clergy, such as monks, friars and priests, often led a life of itinerant austerity, traveling from town to town, preaching in exchange for charitable contributions and shelter.  Though these men were often solitary crusaders, orders of clergy began taking it upon themselves to spread their teachings across the land.  In 1214, Saint Dominic, along with 16 of his disciples, founded the Roman Catholic religious order known as the Dominicans at Toulouse, France for the purpose of combatting the heresies of the time with preaching and teaching.  In 1216, Pope Honorius III granted the Dominicans papal confirmation, and granted them special privileges, including the right to preach and hear confessions anywhere without obtaining local authorization.  Dominicans were unflaggingly devoted to the evangelization of the heretical and uneducated.  During the crusades, a series of military invasions organized by Western Christians against Muslim powers, clerics often accompanied soldiers to help maintain their morale.  They also took the opportunity to teach, preach to and convert non-Christians.

[UNIT_CRAWLER_HISTORICAL]
Using the same technology developed for constructing deep-water undersea colonies and deep-sea mining operations, military scientists developed a craft that could transport armed forces through the benthos.    Because it skims the ocean surface, keeping an extremely low sonar and radar signature, it earned the nickname "crawler."  Although it saw limited civilian use, the crawler became the transport unit of choice for stealth operations because it lacked the vulnerability of air, land and ocean-surface transport.  Its ability to invade underwater cities also made it indispensible for undersea raids.

[UNIT_DESTROYER_HISTORICAL]
In the 1890s, the term destroyer referred to 250-ton vessels deployed to protect battleships from torpedo boats.  By World War I, torpedo-boat destroyers became advanced torpedo boats themselves, and were often deployed ahead of battle fleets to scout for the enemy fleet, attack the destroyers with cannon fire and then launch torpedoes against battleships and cruisers.  When submarines became the main torpedo-launching vessel, shipbuilders outfitted destroyers with hydrophones and depth charges to protect battle fleets and merchant-ship convoys against this new tactic.  By World War II, however, the invention of radar and antiaircraft guns added the role of air defense to this already formidable escort ship.

After World War II, the destroyer's dual role of antiaircraft and antisubmarine became even more powerful with the advent of guided missiles.  Modern destroyers commonly carried surface-to-air missiles, antisubmarine torpedoes, antiship missiles and 4 to 5 inch caliber guns.  Some carried small helicopters to aid in sub-hunting, and a few carried cruise missiles.  With a crew of 300, speed capability of 30 knots and a displacement of from 4,000 to 7,000 tons, destroyers were one of the best naval attack craft of the modern age.

[UNIT_DIPLOMAT_HISTORICAL]
Among the ruins of eastern Mediterranean civilizations lay the roots of diplomacy.  Records detailing treaties between Mesopotamian city-states date from 2850 BC.  The first diplomatic language was Akkadian (Babylonian), serving as an international tongue until Aramaic replaced it.  Archaeologists discovered cuneiform tablets from the 14th century BC documenting a diplomatic correspondence, in Akkadian, between the Egyptian court and a Hittite king.  The full texts of treaties between Ramses II of Egypt and Hittite leaders existed as well.  China had leagues, missions and a system of diplomatic correspondence as early as the 8th century BC, and evidence of sophisticated Indian diplomacy in the 4th century BC implies it developed even earlier.  The Greek system of diplomacy, however, became the model for international diplomacy in much of the West for centuries.

Greek heralds were the first diplomats, protected by the gods with immunity from harm.  Hermes, messenger of the gods and patron god of heralds, was associated with the institution of diplomacy.  Although, as the herald of Zeus, he gained a reputation for being persuasive and eloquent, he was also known as a dishonest knave, a stigma that became associated with diplomats well into modern times.  Heralds were recognized internationally as unassailable, meaning that, even in foreign lands, they were almost never assaulted, imprisoned or otherwise harmed.  To signify their inviolable status, heralds and messengers often carried an emblem, such as a message stick, and were received by their hosts with great ceremony.  Because of this, heralds were often used as contacts between nations at war.  They often preceded small groups of envoys to arrange safe passage.  Envoys, traveling in groups to ensure loyalty, were politically prominent orators dispatched to sway foreign assemblies and leaders.

The Greeks established many diplomatic conventions, including principles of international conduct, diplomatic vocabulary, and international law that survived well into the modern age.  Greek diplomats negotiated truces, treaties, alliances and neutrality, and held conventions, conferences and receptions.  They laid the foundation for a multilateral diplomacy system that evolved and transformed over the next two millenia.

The Dreadnaught was the most ingeniously designed military vehicle in history.  One of the first watercraft to make use of smart materials, its exterior was comprised of a voluntarily elastic substance that enabled the dreadnaught to propel itself through water by mimicking the undulations of a sea creature.  It could harden into a nearly impenetrable carapace of armor or languidly morph around a natural rock formation.  It is capable of dramatic, chameleon-like camouflage techniques.  When near the surface of the ocean, the dreadnaught's exterior would sense the light and selectively reflect only a fraction of the visible spectrum, making it barely visible to passing craft.  Its arsenal included plasma weaponry and conventional torpedoes.  The dreadnaught was unquestionably the zenith of military technology and the most feared ship in the world.

[UNIT_ECO_RANGER_HISTORICAL]
Developed out of the Gaia Theory experiments of the Eden Project, the Eco-Ranger's roots lied in the application of nanotechnology to pollution elimination and control.  The Eden Project sought to develop a nanite that ferretted out polluting elements and eliminated them.  Once the technology was successfully applied, however, a faction of Ecotopian scientists involved in the Eden Project took the application a step further, designing nanites to annihilate any trace of humanity.  By seeking out any manmade entity, be it a synthetic material, non-natural chemical or polluting agent, the Eco-Ranger erased any trace of humanity on the land.  Entire cities simply disappeared, their inhabitants, buildings replaced by pristine wilderness.  This weapon eclipsed any other nuclear, biotech or nanotech weapon to come before it.  Although the Eden Project started out in the interest of addressing global pollution, its designers scarcely envisioned that their noble intentions would beget the destructive power of the Eco-Ranger.

[UNIT_ECO_TERRORIST_HISTORICAL]
The Ecotopian philosophy of radical environmentalism, comprised of a way of life that was most in harmony with nature, emerged as a full-fledged political movement in the early 22nd century.  The Ecotopians sought not only to repair the damage wrought by centuries of unchecked progress but also to design a system of living that guaranteed the health of the planet by minimizing the human impact on ecologies.  Ecotopians advocated the elimination, by any means available, of any systems that generated pollution.  The Ecotopian Elite Guard was established in the mid 22nd century as a special wing of the Ecotopian National Guard.  The Elite Guard, known by other nations as "Eco-Terrorists," raided cities, detonating nanite bombs designed to take out antiquated fossil-fuel-burning power plants.  Though their methods were controversial, they won many passionate adherents within Ecotopian nations.  The Ecotopians invested heavily into military applications of nanites, and their reliance on stealth and mass destruction earned them few allies in the world community.

[UNIT_EMPATHIC_DIPLOMAT_HISTORICAL]
As geneticists began to delve into the vast world of gene therapy and its many applications, they originally sought to eliminate the genetic roots of disease and deformity in humans.  In the process of searching for the genetic roots of Alzheimer's disease, geneticists discovered a way to increase the general use of brains.  It was common knowledge that, at any given time, a human being only used between 10 and 30 percent of their brain for even the most intensive tasks.  They engineered a gene that enabled a two-fold increase in brain use, which vastly increased specific capacities of .  Unfortunately, they were unable to pinpoint and target a particular capacity or aptitude.  Rather, children implanted with this gene would develop an unpredictable, but usually beneficial, new aptitude.  Some grew to be towering intellects, master craftsmen and amazingly talented artists.  A handful of people developed superbly heightened emotional capacities.  These "empaths," as they were called, found a place in the business and governmental realms as masters of conflict resolution and diplomacy.  Endowed with the abilities to sense the emotional states of those they encountered, they were uniquely gifted in the art of negotiations, mediation and ambassadorship.

On October 24, 2095, 150 years to the day after the establishment of the United Nations, an international organization of Empathic Diplomats created the World Peace Center, dedicated to the preservation of peace and the pursuit of global harmony.

[UNIT_FASCIST_HISTORICAL]
The Fascist governments of Italy, Germany and Spain in the mid-20th century were distinguished by their zealous adherence to militaristic, authoritarian ideals.  Fascist leaders, such as Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler and Francisco Franco, relied on strong military and state police forces to enforce order, seize and maintain power, root out dissidents and fulfill on their expansionist foreign policies.  Whether state police, special forces or standard military, fascist soldiers exhibited a fanatical devotion to their role in the state.  The de facto police state that proliferated in the three major European fascist states afforded the military and police huge powers over the lives of citizens.  Fascists gained a reputation for violent, determined military action and 

Mussolini organized the Camicie Nere, or Blackshirts, to help him seize power and destroy the political and economic organizations of the Socialists in 1920.  They attacked hundreds of Socialists, Communists, republicans and other non-fascist political organizations, murdering hundreds of people.  On February 1, 1923, Mussolini transformed the Blackshirts into a national militia, the Voluntary Fascist Militia for National Security.  They continued to act as the military and police arm of the Italian fascist state until Mussolini's assassination in 1943.

In April 1925, Adolf Hitler established the Schutzstaffel (German, "Protective Echelon") as a small personal bodyguard force.  A black-uniformed elite corp of the Nazi party, the SS rose to power along with Hitler, garnering tremendous police and military powers.  He also created a paramilitary organization known as the Sturmabteilung (German "Assault Division").  Known by several names - Brownshirts, Storm Troopers, the SA - their violent methods of intimidation played a vital role in Hitler's rise to power.  Perhaps most famous of the fascist military forces, the Gestapo (short for Geheime Staatspolizei, or "Secret State Police") were the political police of Nazi Germany responsible for the elimination of opposition forces and dissidents within Germany.  The ruthless, atavistic force with which the Gestapo operated was one of the most diabolical aspects of the Nazi apparatus.

The fighter airplane, which was primarily designed to destroy other aircraft in combat, was introduced in the first World War, but did not played a key role until World War II.  They were often the highest performing aircraft of their times, capable of outflying and outmaneuvering opposing fighters.  They were armed with weapons specially designed to hit enemy aircraft, such as rapid-fire machine guns.

During World War II, all-metal, propeller-engine fighters were capable of speeds of 450 miles and reached ceilings of 35,000 to 40,000 feet.  Some of the more notable fighters from that period were the British Spitfire and Hurricane, the U.S. P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang, the German Focke Wulf FW-190 and the Japanese Zero.  Uses of fighters included air support for naval sorties, reconnaissance, light bombing runs, dogfighting, harrassment and support for ground attacks.

The Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus burned down a Pisan fleet in the eleventh century with ships equipped with this volatile concoction that ignited upon impact with water.  He ordered each of his ships set with a lion's head made of iron or bronze. Tubes fed through the lions' mouths into containers of Greek fire, giving the lions the appearance of spewing magnificent breaths of fire on the wooden ships of their enemies.

[UNIT_Z_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT_HISTORICAL]
As the global economy began to explode in size in the late 20th century, there emerged a tremendous need for new systems of delivery of raw materials and trade goods.  Most of the existing transit systems, rail, shipping and trucking already handled cargo as a primary duty.  These disparate systems began to integrate into global shipping operations in order to meet the demands of the international economy.  Although many large corporations employed their own private shipping operations, several shipping conglomerates emerged to facilitate most of the international freight transport in the modern era.  

A standard container size made shipping easier.  A single 8 ft x 8 ft by 20 ft container could fit on a truck trailer, two of them could fit on a rail car and several thousand could fit in huge container ships.  They made loading easier by requiring only one kind of crane to load and unload ships.  Many of the world's largest cities expanded their ports to accommodate these behemoth watercraft.  Other bulk cargo, such as oil, required specially designed ships to transport.

[END]

[UNIT_FRIGATE_HISTORICAL]
The PT boat was a high-speed attack boat primarily used by the United States Navy in the early to mid-20th century.  It was armed with two to four torpedoes, several depth charges and 20-mm and 40-mm guns.  Typically crewed by 14 soldiers, they averaged about 80 feet in length and could travel up to 40 knots.  They were fast, maneuverable, and very effective at night missions.

The Patrol Torpedo (PT) Boat evolved out of the American Civil War era practice of deploying ordinary boats to plant explosives on enemy ships at anchor under the cover of darkness.  In 1935, Britain built what became known as the motor torpedo boat: a high-speed attack boat adept at swift attacks, especially on submarines.  In 1938, PT boats modeled after the British type entered service in the U.S. Navy.  They played an important role in combat around the Phillipine Islands in World War II, but most were removed from the Navy's active list after the war due to their short cruising range and inability to operate in rough seas.  About 25 PT boats, modified for speed (by removing the torpedoes) were active in the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1968 but fell out of action and were eventually phased out as other ships, such as destroyers, diversified their arsenals and capabilities.

[UNIT_FUSION_TANK_HISTORICAL]
The fusion tank was the answer to many of the prayers of generals and military strategists across the world.  Hover infantry were quickly becoming the dominant force on the battlefield, with their ability to negotiate any terrain, strike swiftly and then scatter.  Conventional artillery and tanks were the only long-range, armored land assault craft available.  Squadrons of hover infantry, employing hand-held anti-tank munitions, literally ran circles around the slow-moving, bulky tanks, wiped out entire armies.  Employing much of the same technology that powered the hover infantry's notorious anti-gravity capabilities, scientists developed a larger-scale anti-gravity levitation and propulsion system.  Unlike the hover infantry's land-based system, the fusion tank's anti-grav system enabled it to travel over shallow water, which increased the fusion tank's operating range and functional capabilities.  

The fusion tank could penetrate heavily armored and fortified targets with its high-powered pulse laser cannon, and track multiple small targets with its smaller magnetic pulse guns.  It rendered conventional tanks nearly obsolete and brought an armored compliment to the hover infantry's swift strike capabilities.

Before the hoplite's arrival on the battlefield around the 8th century BC, warfare primarily consisted of individual combat.  Advances in bronze working made new and heavier armor and weapons available.  Hoplite phalanxes were typically eight, but sometimes as much as fifty, ranks of soldiers. They would break enemy ranks with their highly compact formation and were considered the best fighters in the Mediterranean.

After several years, the hover infantry unit was born.  Although the hover infantry's anti-grav system does not permit him to fly vertically, it acts as propulsion and levitation system that enables him to traverse any solid terrain.  With the arrival of hover infantry on the battlefields, conventional artillery, tank and infantry units began to find themselves outmaneuvered, outgunned and outclassed.

[UNIT_INFANTRYMAN_HISTORICAL]
The earliest firearms were primitive devices, lacking buttstock or trigger, which had to be held under the arm making them difficult to aim.  The harquebus, which employed both of these things, was developed in the late 15th century.  It's slow rate of fire and inaccuracy did not make up for the fact that soldiers could now fire from their shoulders.  Nevertheless, some 16th century armies, most notably the Spanish tercio, employed harquebusiers with pikemen, who would open fire on approaching enemies and then retreat behind the pikemen as the range of combat got closer.  In 1588, 10,000 English troops were experimentally equipped with firearms, against Spanish forces relying on archers; the success of the English forces played a major role in the rise of firearms as the weapon of choice for infantrymen.  

The musket was the first firearm to employ a flintlock firing mechanism.  Heavier and more powerful than a harquebus, it could be relied on to fire 2 to 3 times a minute at 100 to 150 yard range with minimal misfires.  By the end of the Thirty Years' War, infantrymen, armed with muskets, and pikemen were about equal in numbers for most armies.  Smaller tactical groups of infantrymen facilitated quicker rate of group fire with minimal mutual interference.  Lines dropped from 8 to 10 in the 17th century to 2 to 3 at the end of the 18th century.  Military strategists, most notably Prince Maurice of Nassau, a great Dutch military teacher, developed drill - the preparation for war by prescribed movements and formations - to increase efficiency.  The invention of the bayonet in 1670 gave infantries little reason to keep pikemen, and infantry units employed muskets and bayonet exclusively from then on.

Rather than releasing pathogens through time-release capsules or glass vials, they imbued nanites with the agents, which could replicate and spread over a wider area.  Although most nations publicly denounced the use of infectors, virtually every nation employed infectors to some degree in their covert operations.

[UNIT_INTERCEPTOR_HISTORICAL]
Although both the Axis and the Allies employed fighter aircraft equipped with jet engines in World War II, it was too late to significantly impact the outcome of the war.  After 1945, the major world powers endeavored to create a new class of fighter aircraft.  Called interceptors, these craft were designed, like fighters, to seek out and destroy enemy aircraft.  Developments in supersonic jet technology gave rise to a powerful new class of aircraft capable of flying 2 to 3 times as fast as the speed of sound.  The U.S. F-15 Strike Eagle and the Soviet MiG-25 Foxbat were among the most advanced jet fighters of the 1960s, 70s and 80s.  They had fast rates of climb, excellent maneuverability and a formidable arsenal of air-to-air missiles.

The interceptor's extreme speeds and operational altitudes made targeting, striking and destroying other aircraft very complicated, and required an array of advanced electronic, navigational and computational systems.  Single-seated interceptors from the 1980s weighed as much as, and were more complicated to operate than, World War II-era multi-engine bombers.  As interceptor technology advanced, the search and attack functions became increasing automated, almost reducing the pilot's role in combat to monitoring the operation of the equipment.  Modern jet-powered interceptors sooned reached a point where their performance capabilities exceeded the human pilots' abilities to control it.

[UNIT_IRONCLAD_HISTORICAL]
Ships-of-the-line dominated the seas in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries.  This nearly three-decade reign was brought to an end, as wooden warships reinforced with iron armor began to prove themselves in naval combat the world over.  These ships, called ironclads, were first employed by the French in the Crimean War, leading to a naval armor and armaments race between the French and the British.  Both the Union and the Confederacy employed ironclads in the U.S. Civil War.  The Monitor and the Merrimack were undoubtedly the most famous ironclads, fighting the first engagement between ironclad ships in history.

When, early in the Civil War, Union forces abandoned the Norfolk Navy Yard at Portsmouth in Virginia they scuttled the powerful steam frigate Merrimack.  Confederate forces raised it, converted it to an ironclad and renamed it the Virginia.  On March 8th, 1862, the Virginia, commanded by Captain Franklin Buchanan attacked a Union blockading squadron at Hampton Roads sinking or scattering the entire fleet of wooden ships.  The Virginia sustained trivial damage in the conflict.  The next day, however, the Union ironclad Monitor, built by John Ericsson and commanded by Lieutenant John L. Worden, challenged the Virginia, now commanded by Lieutenant Catesby Jones, to a duel.  Although the four-hour conflict resulted in a draw, it revolutionized naval warfare.  Ironclads ruled the seas until the development of the battleship in the 1890s.

[UNIT_KNIGHT_HISTORICAL]
As samurai were the warrior class of feudal Japan, so were knights during the European Middle Ages.  Some knights were vassals holding lands in fief from the lords in whose armies they served.  Entering knighthood was a formalized process.  At around age 7, a young boy destined for a career of war would serve his father as a page.  At age 12, he would join the household of his father's lord for more advanced training in military tactics and the ways of the world.  He was considered a valet until he accompanied his patron on a campaign as écuyer (French, "shieldbearer," root of the modern word esquire) or armiger (French, "weapons bearer").  When his family could afford the cost of knightly equipment and he was considered proficient, he was dubbed a knight.  The dubbing ceremony could be elaborate executed on a royal feast day or a simple touching of the flat blade of a sword on each shoulder in the field of battle.

In much the same was as Japanese samurai adhered to a code of conduct known as Bushido ("the way of the warrior"), knights formulated a code of loyalty, personal integrity and Christian faith that was known as chivalry (from the French word "chevalier," meaning knight).  Knights strived to a Christian ideal of courtesy, deep respect for the Church, loyalty to their superiors and preservation of personal honor.  The Crusades, beginning in the 11th century, were the ultimate expression of the knight's devotion to the Christian Church.  These massive military expeditions, operating under the auspices of the church, spawned the first official orders of knights: Knights dubbed at Christ's tomb became known as knights of the Holy Sepulchre, the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem (Knights of Malta), the Order of the Temple of Solomon (Templars) and the Order of St. Lazarus, which was charged with the special duty of defending leper hospitals.  These orders were international, expressly religious institutions in purpose and form.  Members took vows of celibacy and the organizations themselves operated under hierarchical structures that mimicked the church itself.

From the end of the 11th century to the middle of the 13th, the relationship of knighthood to feudalism changed.  As most knights were enfeoffed landholders, obliged to give 40 days' military service to their lords, the frequency of long-distance expeditions put a strain on the existing ranks.  Lords turned to compulsory service, distraining landholders to join the knighthood.  Even with this new development, knights were reduced to a minority in armies, often acting as officers, as greater numbers of mercenary soldiers were raised to fill the gap.

The traditional knighthood saw a major decline in the 14th and 15th centuries.  Armies of footsoldiers and bowmen consistently defeated knightly armies, and the development of artillery futher marginalized the role of the mounted, armor-clad cavalry unit.  The demise of the Crusades and the rise of centralized monarchy eroded the feudal system in which knights thrived.  By the 16th century, knighthood lost its martial purpose and was relegated to nothing more than an honorific status bestowed by sovereigns.

Whereas the Moray Striker derived its navigation and control systems design from genetic research of existing species of sharks, the Kraken was the first operational vehicle to employ an entirely new organic system, based on no living creature.  The Kraken evolved through many prototypes and iterations, finally settling on a genetically tailored vehicle of unprecedented efficiency and power.  Its propulsion system worked like a turbine engine, taking in seawater and ejecting it with considerable force.  It employed large "gills" that extracted oxygen from seawater, providing internal compartments with a renewable oxygen source.  The Kraken was unquestionably the most formidable underwater assault craft of the Genetic Age.

[END]

[UNIT_LAWYER_HISTORICAL]
From the period of 200 BC to 600 AD in Greco-Roman civilization, the first class of legal specialists distinct from judges emerged.  Originally, there was prejudice against the idea of legal experts charging fees for their services.  Citizens generally knew the law and applied it in business and litigation with advice from kinsmen and advisors.  Nevertheless, as the law became more complex, men, usually patricians, found a need to study the law in depth, and some were considered experts.  They would often serve as magistrates and, in Rome, priests of the official religion specializing in family law.  Roman legal experts became jurisconsults, acting at a trial as nonpartisan consultants prohibited from receiving fees.  Late in the Roman Empire, the modern lawyer, earning a living by fees paid for legal services, emerged.  It was universally recognized that a subversive system of gifts and under-the-table payment rendered the ban on fees merely a fictitious convention, and the state began to regulate fees paid.  Changes in trial methods spelled the demise of the jurisconsult.  The orator, who previously acted as an untrained partisan, became the advocate and was required to become legally trained.  Jurisconsults found roles as legal professors at state-sponsored schools in Rome and Constantinople.  

In modern times, the lawyer acted as an advocate on behalf of his or her client.  They perform all of the functions that, in Roman times, were divided amongst orators and jurisconsults, including introducing evidence, interrogating witnesses and arguing questions of law and fact.  They were beholden to the needs of their client, the adminstration of justice and service to the community.  As legal systems around the world varied, so did the roles of lawyers.  In England, lawyers were divided into barristers, who pleaded in the higher courts, and solicitors, who pleaded in the lower courts.  In the United States, attorneys often specialized in areas of the law, such as criminal, personal injury, corporate, probate and divorce, though many maintained general practices.  The reputation of lawyers through modern times varied widely, from the respected, trusted defender of the public and upholder of the rule of law to the ruthless shark of corporate advocacy to the unscrupulous, money-grubbing shyster.  Regardless of reputation, the lawyer was a prominent and integral aspect of the legal system of almost every modern nation.

Conceived by military strategists as the most effective defensive military craft in history, the leviathan was a product of multiple technological developments that occured over the 21st and 22nd centuries.  It derived powered from a massive internal fusion reactor and moved by way of an anti-gravity hover system.  Its array of enemy tracking systems and arsenal of missiles, bombs, magnetic pulse guns and huge particle beam weapons virtually insured the destruction of targets, be they on land or in the air.  The leviathan was not known for speed or maneuverability, as its sheer size and staggering amounts of armor all but completely thwarted the hover system's ability to move it across terrain.  It gained a reputation for being a perfect defender of cities, and, when stationed in or near a metropolis, the leviathan acted as a nearly impenetrable force, holding ground against legions of fusion tanks and hover infantry as it plucked aircraft out of the sky.  The leviathan often comprised the core of an assault force, acting as a mobile command center, and, when accompanied by more maneuverable armor, infantry and air strike divisions, could secure strategic ground locations with a tenacity never before seen.

The machine gun developed gradually through the 19th century. Early work focused on multi-barrel guns, such as the Gatling gun invented by Richard Gatling in 1862.  However, these guns remained prone to jams due to their reliance on black powder and a gravity-based system of feeding loose bullets into the chamber.  The first true machine guns employed smokeless powder and metallic cartridges to more efficiently . In the 1880s, Hiram Maxim built a single barrel gun that repeated fire by using the force of a single shot to discharge the bullet, reload another cartridge and fire again. By feeding it with a fabric belt of bullets, soldiers could fire the Maxim for indefinite periods, never needing to stop and reload.  This development dramatically increased the effectiveness and purpose of infantry.

[UNIT_MARINE_HISTORICAL]
A stalwart and fierce component of modern combat operations, the marine traced its roots back to the 5th century BC.  In their writings, Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides referred to epibatai, heavily armed sea soldiers in the Greek fleets.  In the 3rd-2nd century BC, the the Greek statesman Polybius described a type of Roman soldier, called milites classiarii ("soldiers of the fleet"), who were trained and armed especially for service aboard Roman warships.  In the Middle Ages, standard soldiers often sailed aboard ships to bolster attack and boarding capabilities.  In the 17th century naval wars, the British and Dutch each raised the first distinct and organized corps of modern marines:  the Royal Marine (1664) and the Koninklijke Nederlandse Corps Mariniers (1665), respectively.  Although other countries maintained marine corps, by far the most famous organization of this kind was the United States Marine Corps. 

Founded in 1775 as a separate military service within the U.S. Department of the Navy, the USMC was primarily charged with seizure and defense of advanced bases and with land and air operations related to naval campaigns.  It was also responsible for service aboard certain naval vessels, as well as providing security for shore installations and U.S. diplomatic missions in foreign countries.  Above any other duty, however, the marines specialized in amphibious attacks, such as those undertaken against Japanese-held islands in the Pacific during World War II.  The USMC participated in every war of the United States, often being the first, or among the first, to fight, executed more than 300 landings on foreign shores and served in every major U.S. naval action since 1775.

During World War II, the anti-aircraft and flak cannon were the chief means of defending against air attacks.

Flying several times the speed of sound, SAMs employed heat-sensitive tracking systems and radar guidance to reach all but the highest flying spy planes.  Even the swiftest planes found SAMs a threat, and planes were soon equipped with chaff and flares to attempt to fool the missile's tracking systems into following alternate objects or heat sources.  SAMs mounted on a vehicle increased operation range.

[UNIT_MOREY_STRIKER_HISTORICAL]
In the early days of genetics, the primary focus of research was related to unlocking the secrets of cloning.  It was not until much later that scientists began to approach genetics from the perspective of systems analysis.  The noted geneticist Benjamin D. Hagerty was the first to put forth the notion that, by studying the ways in which organic systems, such as the nervous or circulatory system, operated, scientists could gain insight into the nature of systems themselves. Furthermore, studying the way in which systems with the same function varied from species to species, they could also uncover the ways in which systems evolved.  His research garnered him the 2029 Nobel Prize for Genetics and pioneered a completely new field of genetics research.

The first military application of organic systems design culminated in the development of the highly classified underwater scout craft called the Moray Striker.  By analyzing the genetic composition of sharks, geneticists uncovered many of the ways in which sharks operated as hunters.  The Moray Striker's control systems were designed to mimic the complex web of internal and external feedback systems sharks employ to seek food, navigate, fight, scout and avoid threats.  Unlike a shark, the Moray Striker is primarily a reconnaissance craft.  Its superb sensors and wide range of vision make it ideally suited to fast, silent, wide-eyed operation.

[UNIT_NUCLEAR_SUBMARINE_HISTORICAL]
With the commission of the first nuclear powered submarine, the USS Nautilus, in 1954, the nature of naval combat and, particularly, submarine tactics, was forever altered.  Before this, conventional, diesel-electric submarines approached their target on the surface to avoid draining their batteries.  They submerged only when just out of sight of their target and could only approach at very low speeds.  Commanders did this to conserve battery power for after their attack when they would have to use full underwater power to evade counterattack.  Even after this, a full battery charge would last only an hour or two at top underwater speed.  This limitation suited submarines to attacking slower, less defended ships, and meant that they could not engage fast surface warships, such as battleships and aircraft carriers.

Nuclear submarines, by contrast, had a single power supply for both surface and submerged operation.  Powered by the small amount of enriched uranium fuel in its reactor, a nuclear sub could operate fully submerged at full speed indefinitely.  They could operate freely before and after attacking, keeping up with the fastest of surface ships.  In the Falkland Islands conflict of 1982, the British nuclear submarine, HMS Conqueror, demonstrated its revolutionary new power by tracking the swift Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano for more than 48 hours before closing in to sink it.  For the first time, fast warships were vulnerable to submarine attack.

Although major world powers continued to develop both diesel-electric and nuclear vessels concurrently, some abandoned the old technology altogether.  Over the course of the next four decades, nuclear submarines gradually took over in the navies of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China.

The Nuke is an intercontinental missile with a payload of nuclear warheads.  One of the most destructive weapons available to any empire, the Nuke causes considerable destruction to its target and surrounding area.  The environmental impact of the Nuke constitutes an Atrocity, laying waste to a significant area around the point of impact.  Though the allure of the Nuke's efficient and widespread destruction is powerful, one must consider the far-reaching political, social and environmental impacts of such a weapon.
[END]

[UNIT_NUKE_HISTORICAL]
First conceived of and introduced in the mid-20th century, nuclear weapons represented a exponential increase in the power of ranged warfare.  Nuclear weapons derived their great explosive power from the sudden release of energy associated with the splitting, or fission, of the atomic nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium or plutonium.  As part of the Manhattan project, the ultra-secret United States government research project that took place from 1942-1945, the U.S. built and tested the first plutonium atomic bomb, detonating it at a remote location 120 miles south of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  What set nuclear bombs apart from conventional explosive warfare was their explosive force.  

On August 6, 1945, the United States deployed the first nuclear weapon in warfare, dropping a bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.  The single explosion, which had the force of more than 15,000 tons of TNT, completely devastated a four square mile area in the heart of the city of 343,000 people.  66,000 people were killed instantly, while another 67,000 were injured.  Nearly 70 percent of the city's structures were destroyed or damaged.  Three days later, the U.S. dropped a plutonium-type atomic bomb on Nagasaki.  This blast, equal to 21,000 tons of TNT, killed 39,000, injured 25,000 and destroyed or seriously damaged 40 percent of the city's structures.  This attack prompted the surrender of the Japanese forces and the end to the Pacific conflict of World War II.  After the war, the U.S. conducted dozens of test explosions in remote locations in Nevada and at Enewetak atoll in the Pacific Ocean.  Other nations entered the arms race in subsequent years:  the Soviet Union in 1949, Great Britain in 1952, France in 1960, China in 1964, India in 1974 and Pakistan in 1998.

Later iterations of nuclear weapons involved nuclear warheads attached to intercontinental ballistic cruise missiles and the destructive power of nuclear weapons increased with the introduction of fusion, or thermonuclear, bombs.  Whereas fission bombs were measured in kilotons, equal to 1,000 tons of TNT, fusion bombs were measured in megatons, equal to 1,000,000 tons of TNT.  Although nations also developed smaller "tactical" nukes, by the end of the century, many possessed dozens of thermonuclear weapons, each possessing exponentially more destructive power than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

[UNIT_PARATROOPER_HISTORICAL]
During World War II, military forces deployed parachute-equipped infantrymen called paratroopers.  Planes laden with paratroopers could fly deep behind the front lines of conflict and drop directly on enemy emplacements.  They could be used to interrupt supply lines, strike command centers, conduct reconnaissance and, perhaps most important, capture and hold crucial objectives like bridges and key terrain.  Aircraft also enabled infantry to deploy quickly over a larger area.  Paratroopers and airmobile forces became vital to peacekeeping and humanitarian missions beyond the reach of conventional, land-based transportation.  One of the most famous uses of paratroopers occured on June 6, 1944 in the invasion of Normandy, France.  Allied paratroopers landed behind enemy lines before sunrise and covertly secured strategic areas to make it easier for other soldiers to come ashore from boats.

Although its hover system was not designed for moving over land, the plasma destroyer's long-range bombard capabilities made it ideal as support for amphibious assaults, outclassing the battleship in speed, strength and firepower.  Its considerable arsenal of particle accelerator beams and magnetic pulse guns delivered unprecedented levels of armor-piercing destruction.  Second generation plasma destroyers utilized a long-range enemy tracking system that enabled it to actively defend against any naval threats.

Even though commercial applications of fluid breathing systems were stymied by the unwillingness of regulatory agencies to approve their use, the military found several secret uses for the system.  By far the most advanced was the scout submarine.  Powered by a small nuclear reactor, it was the first manned craft to deploy with no oxygen systems or pressurized hull of any kind.  The two occupants wore deep suits fitted with fluid breathing systems and could explore even the deepest trenches and underwater canyons.  The military secretly contracted scout subs for scientific research missions on occasion but, more often than not, utilized its speed and wide vision range for long-range reconnaissance missions.  It derived its stealth capabilities from a sonar-absorbing, composite exterior surface and a thermally shielded propulsion system that minimized its heat signature.

Since prehistoric times, people often lived a nomadic lifestyle, travelling from place to place, searching for food and shelter.  Some cultures grew weary of this life and opted to settle on fertile ground.  The development of agricultural techniques and tool making made it easier to establish themselves in a single place, grow food, defend their land and harvest resources.  As people formed the first towns and villages and populations grew, small groups would sometimes leave their villages to explore new territory and found new cities.  They sometimes accompanied an army for protection.  Their reasons for striking out on their own were varied: some sought to expand a fledgling nation's borders, some to escape persecution and others desired new or better surroundings.

[END]

[UNIT_SHIP_OF_THE_LINE_HISTORICAL]
As 17th-century naval combat increased in frequency and intensity, particularly in the Anglo-Dutch wars, naval strategists developed the formation of heavy warships call line ahead.  In the line ahead formation, each ship followed in the wake of another, making it easier for each ship in the line to have a clear range for their broadside guns.  Up until the line-ahead tactic, ships of widely varying strength comprised a typical line.  The term ship of the line originated in the 1700s to describe the only suitable ships "to lie in the line of battle."

Ships of the line varied widely in strength and size.  First-raters carried as many as 136 guns but they were considered cumbersome.  The 74-gun third-rater combined speed and maneuverability with decent attack power comprised most of the ships of the line of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Approximately 175 feet long with two full gun decks, these ships dominated the seas until the development of the battleship in the 1860s.  The British ship of the line Victory, the personal ship of Viscount Nelson launched in 1765 and preserved in dry dock in 1805, is a classic example of the larger of the ships of the line, with three gun decks of 24-pound guns.

[UNIT_SLAVER_HISTORICAL]
The Vikings of Northern Europe often raided other countries in order to capture slaves for sale on the open market.  Throughout the ancient world, conquering empires often enslaved the populations of cities they conquered, sending them to their home countries to work.  The international slave trade proliferated in one form or another for much of the first two millenia AD.  The Ottoman Turks gave the Slavic people of central Europe plots of land in exchange for their sons, who were employed in special regiments of the Ottoman armies.  Those "sclavi" ("sclavus," meaning Slavic, the origin of the modern word slave) who survived could return home to their land and live as free men.  Although this was not a forceful slave raid, it was an exchange born out of duress and intense pressure from Ottoman rulers intent on conquering Europe.

[UNIT_SPY_HISTORICAL]
Throughout history, leaders of nations have always required vast amounts of information in order to implement foreign policy, military strategy, diplomatic negotiation and participation in international organizations.  To sate this thirst, and to protect their safety and interests, governments have always maintained some kind of intelligence capability.  Not surprisingly, all nations have laws against espionage, but most have vast networks of spies operating in other lands.

The Chinese military theorist Sun Tzu espoused the importance of intelligence in his book The Art of War (circa 500 BC).  In it, he gave detailed instructions for espionage systems, including double agents and defectors.  Until the rise of nationalism in the 18th century, and the growth of standing armies and diplomatic establishments, intelligence-gathering operations were indiscriminately designed by rules and military leaders.  

Joseph Fouché, duc d'Otrante, minister of police during the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, established one of the first political espionage systems.  Fouché retained a network of police agents and professional spies to root out conspiracies by the Jacobins and Bourbon Royalists to seize power.  In the early 19th century, the Austrian statesman Prince von Metternich also employed an organization of political and military spies.  The most notorious intelligence organizations of the 19th century was the dreaded Okhrana (Department for Defense of Public Security and Order) of the Russian tsars, created in 1825 to search for internal opposition to the current regime.

Much of World War I was fought on the basis of poor intelligence, due to the fact that many nations entered the war lacking sufficient espionage resources.  This, along with advances in communications and aviation technology, led to major expansion in intelligence agencies.  The Fascist governments of Europe and the military dictatorship in Japan, with their expansionist foreign policies, established counterespionage agencies, most notably the Gestapo in Nazi Germany.  This led democratic nations to establish counterintelligence operations as well.

Developed in the 1980's and successfully tested during the Persian Gulf War, the stealth bomber was the second airplane to employ stealth technology in the U.S. Air Force. Named the "Spirit," it combined advanced composite materials and coatings to absorb radar signals and minimize detection. Although the B-2 had a vast range and could carry both nuclear and conventional armament, its $1.3 billion price tag made it a difficult expense to justify in peacetime.

[END]

[UNIT_STEALTH_FIGHTER_HISTORICAL]
What set the stealth fighter apart from other strike aircraft was its ability to minimize enemy radar detection.  It used highly advanced composite materials and coatings to absorb radar transmissions and reduce reflections to an enemy's radar receiver.  The use of smoothly rounded shapes instead of sharp edges and points also helped to reduce reflections.  Stealth fighters also carried missiles and other weapons conformally rather than as protruding attachments.  Weapons recessed within the structure of the aircraft further minimizing drag and radar signature.

Stealth technology was not without its costs.  The first stealth fighter, the United States Air Force's F-117, was extremely expensive to build and maintain.  The rounded design demanded highly sophisticated flight control systems, the materials were heavy and reduced its range and payload capacity, existing weapons had to be modified for conformal carriage.  Nevertheless, stealth fighters proved their worth in the Persian Gulf War, crippling Iraqi command and communications centers with surgical guided weapons strikes.

[UNIT_SUBMARINE_HISTORICAL]
The first submarines, developed and tested by both navies of the American Civil War, were extremely primitive "manned torpedoes".  By the turn of the century, however, European and American companies developed a number of improved submarine designs.  Submarines employed a combination of diesel combustion engine and battery power to alternate between surface and underwater modes.  After approaching their target on the surface to avoid draining their batteries, they submerged only when just out of sight of their target, attacking at very low speeds.  Commanders did this to conserve battery power for after their attack when they would have to use full underwater power to evade counterattack.  Even after this, a full battery charge would last only an hour or two at top underwater speed.  This limitation suited submarines to attacking slower, less defended ships, and meant that they could not engage fast surface warships, such as battleships and aircraft carriers.

Samurai were the warrior class during the feudal period of Japanese history from the 12th century until 1871.  They were the military retainers of the feudal landowners known as daimyo (Japanese, "great holders of private land").  The samurai of the Kamakura period (1192-1333) developed themselves as stoic, military experts, in sharp contrast to the more refined samurai of the imperial court.  As the influence of Zen Buddhism began to spread during the Muromachi period (1338-1573), samurai culture produced some of the uniquely Japanese arts, such as the tea ceremony, that existed well into modern times.  The model samurai followed the code of Bushido (Japanese, "The Way of the Warrior"), which maintained bravery, honor and loyalty as more sacred than life itself.  For samurai, ritual suicide by disembowlement (seppuku) was a institutionally and culturally respectable alternative to dishonor, cowardice and defeat.

Until the development of the internal combustion engine in the late 1800s, ships relied on sails and steam engines for power.  Internal combustion engines, although not practical for extremely large ships, were ideal for smaller ships that could not necessarily cope with boiler rooms, which were heavy and required a lot of space.  The "Vandal," built in 1903, was one of the first cargo ships to employ a diesel engine.  The so-called "Liberty" and "Victory" ships were constructed to ferry American soldiers across the Atlantic Ocean to the front lines of the European theatre of World War II.

[END]

[UNIT_URBAN_PLANNER_HISTORICAL]
It was the disorder and squalor of 19th century Industrial Revolution-era cities, with their festering, overcrowded slums, which prompted the first modern urban planning and development efforts.  Early city planners imposed laws for the standardization of housing, sewage, sanitation, public health and, perhaps most important, water supply conditions.  Urban planners also introduced parks and playgrounds into congested city neighborhoods, providing places for recreation, as well as visual relief.

20th century urban planning saw the rise of the concept of zoning -- setting limits for building height, neighborhood density and construction activity.  Most cities had grown organically, and as the Industrial Revolution shifted the role and dominance of cities to the fore, they became sprawling, disorganized eyesores, with commercial, industrial and residential areas intertwined and seemingly built on top of each other.

Public transportation was the answer to many issues -- overcrowding, complex street systems, traffic, congested commercial districts, and shortages of housing -- that plagued the sprawling metropolis.  Urban planning was also important to the revitalization of Europe after World War II, where planners shifted their focus to the reconstruction of areas destroyed by war.

By the middle of the 20th century, urban planners experimented with new concepts for towns and cities, and endeavored to create the ideal urban area.  "Planned communities" sprang up, with transportation, recreation, industrial and residential systems in place.  Rather than focusing on fixing problems, planners sought to develop urban areas that would evolve with the changing needs of their citizenry.  Though there have been spectacular failures, many planned cities are a testament to the wisdom of long-term, scalable urban plans that focus on the total living experience.

[UNIT_WAR_WALKER_HISTORICAL]
The development of cybernetics, itself a culmination of discoveries into neural interface technology and gene therapy, encouraged military theorists to rethink the systems by which a human could pilot a vehicle.  Up until the development of the war walker, pilots used manual control devices - joysticks, foot pedals, throttles - to manipulate their vehicle, from supersonic jet to common jeep.  The neural interface-based cybernetic control system was a link between the biological and the mechanical, enabling the conversion of thoughts, registered as neurochemical brain impulses, into computer system commands.  In this way, a pilot could control his vehicle, including propulsion, movement, targeting and weapons systems, through a combination of neural and manual commands.  The feedback systems in war walkers were capable of "remembering" the idiosyncracies of their human pilots.  Veteran pilots were often highly skilled, in large part due to their walkers' ability to anticipate their movement, targetting and weapon combination preferences.  The war walker soon became one of the most feared military entities in the world, largely due to a superstition that walkers could continue to effectively fight even if their pilots died in the "rig."  Although the notion of the sentient, un-piloted war walker was almost certainly a legend, this blured line between man and machine only served to increase the mystique and ominence of this terrible machine.

[WONDER_THE_AGENCY_HISTORICAL]
Formally created in 1947, the Central Intelligence Agency grew out of the World War II Office of Strategic Services (OSS).  In the U.S., the army, navy and Federal Bureau of Investigation previous handled intelligence and counterintelligence efforts.  Competition, lack of coordination and a duplication of efforts complicated matters and garnered the U.S. criticism from its allies for not having a central intelligence organization.  In June 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the OSS to rein in the disparate strands of intelligence gathering under a single aegis. 

During the Second World War, the OSS collected and analyzed any foreign intelligence related to areas where U.S. military forces operated.  At its height, the OSS numbered nearly 12,000 members.  It gathered evidence from secret agents, it carried out disinformation and counterpropaganda actions and it coordinated special operations behind enemy lines supplying and directing resistance fighters, perpetrating sabotage and demolition.  It was dismantled in October 1945, and, in its place, President Harry S. Truman established, by executive order, the Central Intelligence Group and a National Intelligence Authority in 1946.  These groups gathered key players from the hastily convened OSS and attempted to direct postwar intelligence operations with some semblance of central control.

In 1947, Congress created the National Security Council and, under its direction, the Central Intelligence Agency.  The newly formed CIA was to advise the NSC on intelligence matters bearing on national security, coordinate communication of intelligence within the government and carry out national-security-bearing intelligence operations at the behest of the NSC.

[WONDER_THE_APPIAN_WAY_HISTORICAL]
The Via Appia, or Appian Way, was first and most famous ancient Roman road.  Begun in 312 BC by censor Appius Claudius Caecus, it originally ran southeast from Rome 162 miles to Tarentum and was later extended to the Adriatic coast to the huge port at Brundisium.  Roman roads were noted for their solid foundations, straightness and use of concrete made from volcanic ash and lime.  It averaged 20 feet in width and had a slightly cambered surface to facilitate drainage.  The foundation was made of heavy stone blocks cemented together with line mortar.  Expertly fitted polygonal blocks of volcanic concrete formed its surface.

Horace and Statius called the Via Appia "longarum regina viarum," or "queen of long-distance roads."  It was the main highway between Rome and the seaports of southern Italy.  It was so vital to trade, not only within Italy but also with Greece and other eastern Mediterranean nations, that a curator of praetorian rank was charged with administering it.  Portions of the Appian Way remain intact in parts of the Italian countryside.

Along with Plato, Aristotle was one of the two greatest Greek intellectual figures.  More than any other thinker, Aristotle had a profound affect on Western philosophy and science that continued well into modern times.  In 335 BC, he founded a school in a grove sacred to Apollo Lyceius.  Aristotle was in the habit of walking around the grove of the Lyceum while lecturing his students.  This earned the school and its students the label of Peripatetics (from the Greek words peri and patein, meaning "around" and "walk," respectively).  The notes for his lectures, later edited by his successors, comprise the bulk of Aristotle's extant writings.

The matter decompiler improvement helped cities reduced pollution and was a major boon to efforts to preserve the environment.  By enabling people to decompile their solid waste into basic elements, matter decompilers simultaneously reduced pollution and provided raw materials that could be reused.  Unfortunately, many cities could not afford the initial cost of building a matter decompiler.  Pioneering nanotechnology expert David Ray conceived of a nationwide matter decompiler that would supply all cities with the technology.  The Central Matter Decompiler would act as a source of nanites, delivering them to any city with a matter decompiler.  This would dramatically reduce the cost of installation, as cities would be able to build a simpler "recipient" decompiler without having to worry about supplying nanites for the matter processing.

[WONDER_CHICHEN_ITZA_HISTORICAL]
Chichén was a city founded around the 6th century AD, most likely by Maya peoples native to the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.  It consisted of many structures, including the Akabtzib (House of the Dark Writing), the Chichanchob (Red House), the Iglesia (Church), the Casa de las Monjas (Nunnery), and the observatory El Caracol (The Snail).  THe Maya abandoned Chichén in 670, but archaeological evidence suggests that, at sometime between the 10th and 12th centuries AD, after the collapse of the Maya cities of the southern lowlands, the Itzá, a tribe of Maya speakers influenced by the Toltec of Central Mexico, resettled Chichén.

The Itzá constructed a few buildings in addition to those that first existed in Chichén, most notably El Castillo (The Great Pyramid).  A magnificent structure, it rose 80 feet above the Main Plaza of the city.  Each of its four sides had 91 stairs and faced a cardinal direction.  When added to the step at the top of the pyramid, the steps totalled 365 - the number of days in a solar year.  It was topped with a carving of a plumed serpent symbolic of Quetzalcóatl (known to the Maya as Kukulcán), one of the major deities of ancient Meso-American culture.  During the equinoxes in the spring and summer, the setting sun cast a shadow giving the appearance of a snake undulating down the stairways.  

In the 19th century, long after the eradication of Maya culture at the hands of Spanish conquerers, Chichén Itzá became a major archaeological site.  Excavations revealed much, including an earlier structure within El Castillo that contained a red jaguar throne studded with jade.

Legends told of the Cult of the Cenote and their practice of human sacrifice to the rain god.  They threw victims into the city's major cenote (a natural well at the northernmost part of the pyramid), along with gold and jade ornaments and other valuables.  In 1904, Edward Herbert Thompson, an American who purchased the Chichén Itzá site, dredged the cenote.  The skeletons and objects of sacrifice confirmed what was considered only a legend.

In the early years of the 21st century, the prevalence of the Internet and the digital economy was a clear indication of a new, fully wired, computer driven world.  The world was in the midst of what some called the Information Revolution - a world power structure that was starting to rely less on money or military might but on the control of data and information.  Challenges to intellectual property and copyright laws filled the courts of the world as government and industry scrambled to cope with a sudden explosion of unregulated commerce, personal freedom and criminal activity.

The concept of a data haven, an ultra-secure, high-speed, colocation hosting facility became increasingly popular.  The notion of hosting data and facilitating transactions outside the jurisdiction of some of the more restrictive nations appealed to many.  In early 2000, the first data haven was created.  Many of the world's nations and business entities seized the opportunity of the data haven, and the host country prospered from the proliferation of worldwide trade.

Until the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 at the hands of the British, Spain and Portugal monopolized the trading of spices from East India.  On December 31, 1600, a royal charter incorporated the English East India Company as a monopolistic trading body formed for the exploitation of trade with East and Southeast Asia and India.  Although they were successful, the company met with opposition from the Dutch in the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) and the Portuguese.  In 1623, Dutch authorities executed English, Japanese and Portuguese traders in what became known as the Amboina Massacre.  After that, the Dutch excluded company members from the East Indies.  Earlier, in 1612, the company defeated the Portuguese in India and won trading concessions from the Mughal Empire.  They traded cotton, silk, indigo and saltpeter, in addition to spices from South India.  It also extended its operations to the Persian Gulf, Southeast Asia and East Asia.  Eventually, it involved itself in politics, acting on behalf of British imperialistic interests in India from the early 18th century to the mid-19th century, and expanding British influence in China in the 19th century.

[WONDER_THE_EDEN_PROJECT_HISTORICAL]
The Eden Project was one of the most controversial research projects of the Diamond Age.  It was originally conceived as a theoretical exploration of the potential applications of nano-machines in cleaning up pollution, a branch of science that became known as Gaia Theory.  Ecotopian scientists involved in the multi-national project, however, harbored sinister intentions for the technology.  Researchers discovered the key to enabling prototypical nanites to target pollution lied in designing them to seek a narrow range of chemicals that comprised the bulk of polluting agents.  Since most of these chemicals were synthetic - products of humanity rather than nature - the Ecotopians in the research group seized on the opportunity to develop a nanite that targetted and destroyed any man-made entity within a set area.  This shift in focus turned the "ecology cleanser" from a benificent tool of world climatactic and environmental repair to a device of mass destruction.  The Eco-Ranger raised the spectre of the first truly efficient, large-scale annihilator of humanity.  It was particularly attractive to ecology-minded governments because it not only produced no pollution, it actually eliminated pollution within the area of effect.  Although commercial applications of Gaia Theory led to advances in pollution control systems, the destructive uses prevailed, and the arena of nanotechnological combat reached large-scale, terrifying proportions.

[WONDER_EGALITARIAN_ACT_HISTORICAL]
The development of the Virtual Democracy form of government signalled a new age in human rights and equality.  Even though democratic governments existed even as early as ancient Greece, they often perpetuated some kind of inequality, be it racial, social or economic.  Modern democracies of the late 20th century were often rife with some of the same injustices present in the most oppressive regimes.  The thrust behind developing a true democracy, free from the easily corruptable institution of representation, was an ardent desire to empower the disenfranchised masses to take control of their government.  Political theorists envisioned a democracy unburdened by the pernicious influence of corporations and special interest groups on the political process.  By eliminating the representatives who often compromised their commitment to the constituencies of citizens in favor of the sums of money dangled before them, a nation of individuals could determine their own futures directly.  The first virtual democracies achieved this aim, powerfully utilizing technology to enabled a true "one-human-one-vote" system.

Long the dreams of human rights activists who struggled to equalize the balance of social, political and economic power in the world's democratic societies, the Egalitarian Act was a fictional document.  They envisioned a bold proclamation reaffirming the equal rights for all citizens, regardless of race, age, gender, and religion.  Even more, they wanted to guarantee access to information, which had become the most important commodity of the modern and genetic ages, for all people.  The virtual democracy had stripped corporations of much of their political power.  As a result, citizens passed sweeping changes to the tax codes and stripped corporations of many of their legal and economic favoritism, which considerably flattened the distribution of wealth.  People who were once poor took advantage of their new economic power to educate themselves, purchase computers and begin participating in the new digital economy.  The Egalitarian Act was the final step in solidifying equal political and social rights for everyone.  On December 5th, 2031, the European Union became the first political entity to enact the Egalitarian Act.  As word spread through the global community, cities around the world teetering on the brink of revolution clamored to join such a progressive nation.  Leaders of oppressive governments found a new challenge from outside of their borders, and many struggled to retain control of their people.

[WONDER_EMANCIPATION_PROCLAMATION_HISTORICAL]
Before the start of the American Civil War, Northern political leaders and abolitionists sought merely to stop the spread of slavery into the western territories that were destined for statehood.  When the Southern states seceded from the Union, marking the beginning of the Civil War, Northerners saw little political purpose in tolerating slavery any further.  The concept of Emancipation suddenly changed from a remote possibility to an eventuality.  Union president Abraham Lincoln declared his intention to preserve the Union however he could - by preserving slavery, by destroying it, or by destroying part and preserving part.  After the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, he issued a proclamation calling on the revolted states to return their allegiance by the end of the year or their slaves would be declared free men.  When no state returned, he issued the declaration on Jan. 1, 1863.

Some historians, and, doubtless some of Lincoln's contemporaries, questioned the validity of the Emancipation Proclamation.  As president, Lincoln lacked the power to issue such a declaration, and, as commander-in-chief of U.S. Armed Forces, he could only issue directions regarding the territory within his lines.  Because the Emancipation Proclamation applied only to territory outside his lines, it was a dubious declariation, lacking any real force.  However, it was significant as a statement of policy to guide the army and as a declaration of freedom that would take effect as the lines advanced.

The Emancipation Proclamation inadvertently lifted the American Civil War to the level of a crusade for human freedom.  It also had many effects on the direction and eventual outcome of the war.  From an international perspective, the Civil War was an unfortunate and calamitous event, as it locked up the world's main source of cotton.  In fact, the Confederate government had expected the English and French governments to intervene in the war.  The transformation of the war into a crusade against slavery precluded any European intervention.  The Emancipation Proclamation also allowed the Union to recruit black soldiers.  Nearly 180,000 black men enlisted during the remainder of the war, significantly bolstering Northern ranks and enabling the Union to crush the rebellion.  

In February 1865, two months before the war ended, Lincoln told portrait painter Francis B. Carpenter that the Emancipation Proclamation was "the central act of my administration, and the greatest event of the nineteenth century."  Lincoln and his compatriots had dealt a deathblow to slavery in the United States, and in December 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified.

[WONDER_GALILEOS_TELESCOPE_HISTORICAL]
Contrary to popular belief, Galileo Galilei, the noted Italian astronomer and physicist, did not invent the telescope.  In 1609, he caught wind of a device in the Netherlands that could show distant things as though they were close by.  Galileo quickly figured out the secret of the invention and made his own three-powered spyglass from lenses purchased at a spectacle maker's shop.  Though others did the same, what distinguished Galileo was that he figured out ways to improve the instrument.  After teaching himself the art of lens grinding, he created increasingly powerful telescopes, and in August of that year he presented an eight-powered instrument to the Venetian Senate.  They awarded him a life tenure and doubled his salary, making him one of the highest paid professors at the University of Padua, where he taught from 1592 until 1610.  

In late 1609, he developed a telescope that magnified up to 20 times.  With it, he observed the heavens and drew the phases of the moon.  He discovered the moon's surface was not smooth, as most thought, but rough and uneven.  In 1610, he discovered several of Jupiter's moons and realized that his telescope showed many more stars than were visible to the naked eye.  He was an adherent of the Copernican heliocentric view of the universe, which stated that the Earth and other planets revolved around the sun.  This earned him enemies in Rome, as Copernicanism was considered heretically inconsistent with Holy Scripture.  A poorly executed Inquisition procedure against other adherents of Copernicanism forced Galileo to recant his assertions.  Despite the official reprimand, his alliances with wealthy and powerful Tuscan and Florentine enabled him to continue working.  His pioneering work in astronomy resonated for centuries, in the sciences of optics, navigation, astronomy and physics.  Galileo's contribution to the human understanding of the universe could not be overstated.

[WONDER_GENOME_PROJECT_HISTORICAL]
On June 26, 2000, scientists involved in two separate projects - the publicly funded Human Genome Project, an international collaboration coordinated by the United States Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Celera Genomics, a private company based in Rockville, Maryland, jointly announced that they had completed a rough draft of the human genome (the complete genetic makeup of human beings).

Researchers approximated the order of 85 percent of the roughly 3.1 billion chemical subunits, called nucleotide base pairs, that constituted the human genome.  However, they had yet to determine the exact count of the estimated 25,000 and 150,000 genes that comprised the human genome.  The US government launched the Human Genome Project in 1990, intending it to last 15 years.  Eventually, research centers in the US, Europe and Japan joined the effort througout the 90s.  In 1998, Celera began their decoding operation, employing the world's largest group of supercomputers.  The rivalry between the government's Genome Project and the Celera's effort heated up, with allegations of profiteering, flawed strategies and moving too slowly from both sides.  Experts concluded, however, that the sometimes publicly harsh rivalry prompted both sides to work faster.

One of the most incredible wonders of the world, the Great Wall of China stretches for 1,500 miles along the border between Northern China and Mongolia.  It is an amalgamation of many walls built at different points in ancient history; the first unified wall was built in the 3rd century BC by the Ch'in dynasty.  Many of the laborers, conscripted from all over China, died during the project.  The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) later added to it.  Guard stations and watchtowers are placed at regular intervals.  It averages 25 ft in height and is 15 ft to 30 ft thick at the base, sloping to 12 ft at the top.  Although the western part of the wall is just an earth mound, the eastern part is earth and stone faced with brick.  China suffered many invasions from the North, which unfortunately proved the Great Wall to be of little military significance.  The fact that much of it still stands in modern times is a testament to the durability of masonry.

A Latin edition of the Bible, it was printed some time between 1450 and 1456 in Mainz, Germany.  Although German bibliographers claim that it was printed by Gutenberg, the edition may have been finished and perfected by Peter Schöffer, Gutenberg's assistant, and Johann Fust, a wealthy financier who acquired Gutenberg's share of the business in a lawsuit.  Regardless of its exact origins, the Gutenberg Bible was one of the first religious texts mass-produced by machine.

[WONDER_HAGIA_SOPHIA_HISTORICAL]
Hagia Sophia, or Aya Sofia, was one of the world's greatest religious monuments and considered by many to be the supreme example of Byzantine architecture.  In AD 360, 30 or so years after Byzantium became the capital of the Roman Empire, Constantius II erected a basilican church.  This church, which burned in 404, was rebuilt by Theodosius II in 415, and was again destroyed by fire in 532.  The Holy Roman Emperor Justinian rebuilt the church from 532-537, rechristening it the Hagia Sophia, or "Church of Holy Wisdom."  Designed by his architects Anthemius of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus, the new structure was fireproof, but, in 558, severe earthquakes caused the magnificent domed ceiling to collapse.  It was rebuilt in 563 and remained as a Christian monument and holy place for centuries.

The Turks converted Hagia Sophia into a mosque when the conquered Constantinople in 1453.  In later years, they gradually removed or obliterated the Christian symbols, plastering and painting over interior figure mosaics, replacing the altar and pulpit with customary Muslim accoutrements and supplanting the cross on the top of the dome with a crescent.  The four minarets that rise at the corners of the building were added one by one over the years.  In 1935, Hagia Sophia was opened as a museum and dedicated as a non-denominational monument to all faiths.

[WONDER_HOLLYWOOD_HISTORICAL]
When Los Angeles was a small city in the new state of California, a prohibitionist from Kansas named Horace Wilcox created Hollywood as a real-estate subdivision in 1887.  He originally envisioned it as a community based on his rather strict religious principles.  Over the next century, however, it would become an internationally recognized symbol of the film and television industry itself, representing, ironically, some of the worst excesses of modern American culture.

Although the earliest movie production studios existed in New York and Chicago, a determined group of filmmakers transferred their operations to Southern California in the early 1900s, laying the foundation for the development of an entertainment industry of mammoth proportions and success.  Hollywood provided ample sunshine, a mild climate, access to varied terrain and a large labor market.  In 1908, one of the first storytelling movies, The Count of Monte Cristo, was completed in Hollywood after filming began in Chicago.  The first Hollywood studio was founded on Sunset Boulevard in 1911, and soon 20 companies began film production in and around Hollywood.  By 1915, it became the center of the United States motion picture industry as more filmmakers relocated from the East Coast.  Such men as D.W. Griffith, Samuel Goldwyn, Cecil B. de Mille, William Fox Adolph Zukor, Darryl F. Zanuck, Harry Cohn and Louis B. Mayer presided over the great film studios - 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldywn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Columbia, Warner Brothers and others.  Despite robust and thriving film communities all of the world, Hollywood continued to dominate global entertainment well into the 21st century.

[WONDER_INTERNET_HISTORICAL]
In 1973, the United States Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) began a project designed to research technologies for interlinking computer networks of various kinds.  Its objective was to develop protocols to allow computers to communicate tranparently across multiple linked networks.  The system of networks that emerged from the "Internetting" project was known as the "Internet."  The protocols system that emerged from this research project was known as the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol suite.

In 1986, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) began development on the NSFNET, which, with its 45 megabit per second facilities, became a major "backbone" of the modern-day Internet.  Eventually, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Energy added backbone facilities known as NSINET and ESNET, respectively.  By 1991, the Internet had grown to include over 5,000 networks in almost 40 countries, serving and connecting more than 700,000 host computers used by more than 4,000,000 people.

Although initially, a large percentage of the support for the Internet community came from the U.S. Federal Government, due to its roots as a government-funded research project, private commercial facilities began to take over in the 1980s and, eventually, comprised the bulk of the system.  Several non-governmental organizations, such as the Internet Activities Board, were formed to supervise progress, organize research and development projects and provide a semblance of central direction to what was essentially a cooperative effort on the part of multiple agencies.

In the 1990s, the Internet was expanded beyond government and university research uses to bring millions of individuals together.  Several companies, called Internet Service Providers (ISPs), began to lease access to the Internet for the purposes of electronic mail and access to the World Wide Web.  The gradual explosion of Internet users expanded the potential of the Internet in the realms of communication, business, marketing and entertainment.

In the mid-21st century, nanotechnology had found applications in countless realms, from science and engineering to manufacturing and construction.  One of the most dramatic and far-reaching uses of nano-machines was the invention of the nanite defuser.  Developed by a coalition of nations, the nanite defuser consisted of a timed release of 2 million nanites into the air for seeking out weapons-grade plutonium and uranium.  Guided by gamma rays, the nanites honed in on the highly radioactive substances contained in nuclear missiles around the world and rendered their triggers inoperative.  The nanites then continued to attack the radioactive substances, working to break them down.  The reaction of the world community to the nanite defuser was overwhelmingly positive.  People rejoiced, as the world was once again free from the frightening and destructive power of nuclear weapons.  What had been a dream for centuries was finally a reality.

He grew the mold in a fluid medium and found that the substance it produced killed many of the most common forms of bacteria ailing humans.  In the late 1930s, Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain purified penicillin and, by 1941, an injectable form of the drug became available.

Doctors used penicillin to treat a range of bacterial infections, including those that caused pneumonia, spinal meningitis, syphilis and staphylococcus infections of the throat.  Although some people were violently allergic to it, penicillin became a principal drug in the war against bacterial infection and widespread use throughout the twentieth century contributed to a healthier population wherever it became available.

Built over a period of 2,700 years, from the beginning of the Old Kingdom to the end of the Ptolemaic Period in Egypt, pyramids were the largest, most elaborate funerary edifices in history.  Built as tombs to honor Egyptian royalty, they were often part of a vast architectural complex that included a mortuary temple and a causeway leading down to a pavilion that was probably connected to the Nile by canal.

Although about 80 royal pyramids have been found in Egypt, the most famous of all pyramids are the three 4th-dynasty (c. 2575-c. 2465 BC) pyramids erected on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the Nile River near Al-Jizah (Giza), northern Egypt.  Of the three, the northernmost, oldest and largest was built for the king Khufu (also known by the Greek name Cheops), the second king of the 4th dynasty.  Known as the Great Pyramid, it is probably the single largest structure ever built on the planet.  The length of each side averages 755 feet at its base and it originally stood more than 480 feet high.  Its sides are all correctly oriented to the four cardinal points of the compass.  The other two pyramids, named for Khafre and Menkaure (in Greek, Chephren and Mykerinus, respectively), the fourth and fifth of the eight kings of the 4th dynasty were smaller.

The Great Pyramid's core was made of yellowish limestone blocks, the outer casing and the inner passages were of finer light-colored limestone, and the interior burial chamber was built of huge blocks of granite. Approximately 2.3 million blocks of stone were cut, transported, and assembled to create the 5,750,000-ton masterpiece of technical skill and engineering ability. The internal walls as well as those few outer-casing stones that still remained in place showed finer joints than any other masonry constructed in ancient Egypt.

[WONDER_THE_SOLARIS_PROJECT_HISTORICAL]
The Solaris Project was the most ambitious scientific undertaking in the history of humankind.  Conducted under a veil of secrecy to rival the Manhattan Project of the mid-20th century, it originally set out to prove that the conversion of matter to energy to new matter was possible.  Primary research, which began in 2268, was conducted in one of the first nanite-constructed space stations.  The project took a little over ten years to complete.  Using their knowledge of unified field theory, nanotechnology and smart materials, Solaris Project scientists designed a small probe to launch into the center of the sun.  They believed the secrets to energy to matter conversion lied in the massive fusion reactions of stars.  The probe returned with a staggering array of new data that led researchers to finally reproduce a controlled energy-to-matter conversion in 2274.  The final piece of the puzzle involved designing a system that would perform this entire process, providing a limitless supply of raw materials with which to build and create things.

The Gaia Controller was the application of this technology.  It was comprised of three distinct groups of componentry.  A system of small satellites circled the planet, collecting space debris, solar energy and various other sources of matter.  Once collected the satellites converted the matter to energy, periodically beaming it down to obelisks placed at regular intervals on the surface.  The obelisks were the primary matter collecting entities in the system, sending out vast groups of nanites designed to hunt out polluting agents in the air, water and earth.  They also acted as receptacles for energy collected from satellites.  Obelisks distributed energy to the various Gaia controller cores in cities around the world.  The controller cores enabled operators to oversee the system, distribute and control energy and provide cities with a limitless supply of energy for the creation of new matter.

In the late 20th century, a society of litigiousness permeated much of the Western World.  Countries like the United States constituted a small fraction of the world's population, but employed half of its lawyers.  The complexity of the criminal code, particularly the huge regulations on personal freedom enacted by reactionary moralists, reached a breaking point in the early 21st century.  The criminal justice system, bogged down by the massive burden of prosecuting petty offenses was poised to collapse under the weight of its own labyrinthine depth.  The Zero-Crime Bill sought to decriminalize a range of crimes limiting individual freedoms, such as narcotics use, prostitution and private sexual conduct.  This ridded prisons of hundreds of thousands of petty criminals, freeing up the justice system to concentrate on criminals and crimes that were more heinous.

THE MAGNIFICENT SAMURAI - SCENARIO RULES

BACKGROUND
- In this scenario, you play as Akimbo Katana, a solitary, wandering warrior living in Southern Japan during the violent death-throes of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  Your objective is to travel across the islands and recruit up to six other samurai to help you defend the village of Shichinen against marauding Bandits.
- This is a Role Playing Adventure, so there is no city building, resource management or scientific research.  And Diplomacy will avail you little, since you are dealing with brutes who only understand the language of steel and blood.

VICTORY/LOSS
- The game is won when the Bandit Leader is defeated.  
- The game is lost either when Akimbo dies, or when a year and a half passes and you haven't defeated the Bandit Leader.

EXPERIENCE
- Akimbo and the other Samurai will gain experience from combat.  More powerful enemies give better experience.  When enough experience is earned, samurai will gain a level, increasing in power.  Akimbo starts at level 1, but the other samurai you meet will start at higher levels.  For this scenario, the maximum level is 9.
