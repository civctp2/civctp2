# Start game strings
SS_START_TITLE		"The Magnificent Samurai"
SS_START_A			"You are Akimbo Katana, a wise and crafty wandering Ronin. You arrived at the village of Shichinin in time to witness the aftermath of a bandit raid. The villagers tell you these bandits come every year after Harvest to relieve them of most of their crop. Your unique code of honor demands that you find some way to help the villagers."
SS_START_B			"Realizing you cannot defeat the Bandit horde alone, you must enlist the aid of other skilled warriors. Seven warriors, including you, should be able to adequately defend the village. The villagers say another Samurai passed through the village not long ago, bound for the island of Oatakark. That's as good a place to start as any..."
SS_SHICHINEN_RETURN	"No, it is best not to return to Shichinen until you have the means to defend the village."
SS_BRIDGE_BURNED	"As you cross the bridge, a well-muscled cutthroat steps out from behind a bush, barring your path. From behind, the thug's partner has set fire to the bridge, blocking any thought of escape."
SS_BRIDGE_BURNED2	"You easily defeat the two brigands. But now you wonder how you will return to the village. Sourly you think, 'I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it...'"

# Katchu and Oatakark strings
SS_SCURVY_MAIDEN_A	"Before you is a derelict boat beached on the shore. The boat has the name 'Scurvy Maiden' written across the front-starboard. Upon closer examination you discover that the boat has one occupant: an unconscious, undernourished, and badly sunburned old sailor." 
SS_SCURVY_MAIDEN_B	"You can tell from the sailor's ragged breaths that he certainly would not have lived much longer. You revive the man, and give him a water skin, which he drains in a single draft. As you apply an herbal salve to the old man's burns, he tells his story..." 
SS_SCURVY_MAIDEN_C	"'My name is Steve-yim, formerly of the doomed island of Oatakark to the East. The volcano there has reawakened twenty years before it was predicted and the prophets claim the island will soon be consumed by the ocean. As one of the few captains of a sea-faring vessel, I wisely hauled anchor right after feeling the first tremors."  
SS_SCURVY_MAIDEN_D	"'And I left just in time. Soon as I pulled out a mob of soldiers charged the docks to commandeer my craft so some snooty noble could escape! In my enthusiasm to leave the island I didn't stock supplies and passed out after a couple days on the open sea. It's lucky you found me. As thanks, I offer you the services of the Scurvy Maiden!'"
SS_GOING_TO_OATAKARK	"Steve-yim rubs his wispy beard nervously, glancing between you and the sun rising over the prow of the ship. 'Say, you wouldn't be thinking of taking us back to Oatakark, would you?'"
SS_NEXT_TO_OATAKARK	"Upon seeing the familiar coast Steve-yim hops up and down on the deck, swearing repeatedly. Then he boldly stomps up to you and waves the frayed end of a floppy rope in your face: 'Has the sun baked your brains? This island is a large, leaky coffin! If you set foot on that shore I swear I won't wait for you!'"
SS_OATAKARK_SHORE_A	"You are surrounded by a group of swordsmen, desperation and madness shines in their eyes as clearly as the sun shines off of their naked blades. Seeing the departing Scurvy Maiden, a couple of the soldiers defy logic by diving into the swelling surf after the ship."
SS_OATAKARK_SHORE_B	"As they rapidly sink beneath the waves you wonder to yourself if they were weighed down by their armor or the rocks in their heads. But you have little time to consider this as the remaining soldiers raise their swords and charge."
SS_OATAKARK_SHORE	"The island constantly rumbles as if it is slowly shaking itself apart. With difficulty you try not to succumb to the panic that has gripped the others trapped on this island. There must be some way to escape..."
SS_KATCHU_A			"This small town has been picked clean of most everything. The only area of interest is the tavern. Inside, you find a drunken Samurai in extremely bad humor. The Samurai is singing a common drinking song loudly and off-key:"
SS_KATCHU_B			"Chow Wang's estate was ablaze, Chow Wang was trapped in the maze\nHe found his wife, said 'On your life bring me a bucket of water'\nShe said 'Dear, one bucket won't cure these flames that are getting hotter'"
SS_KATCHU_C			"Wang said 'Bring it just the same, it is not to drown the flames'\nShe loyally brought the bucket and prayed that with some good luck it\nWould quench the deadly inferno,But barely little did she know\nChow Wang had made other plans"
SS_KATCHU_D			"In the bucket he stuck his head, but before he did that he said\n'Wife, we're both dead, I wish we weren't.,\nBut it's better to drown than be burnt!'"
SS_KATCHU_E			"After the song is finished, the Samurai introduces himself: 'Greetings fellow Shikozu. I am Katchu. I came to this island to find my fortune, but instead found despair. Drink with me!  We are brothers now in that we share the same fate. With good fortune, we'll be drowned in sake instead of seawater!'"
SS_KATCHU_F			"You drag the drunken samurai from the tavern, scolding him sharply: 'Are you a warrior or are you a dog?  Will you lay on your back, show your belly to Fate and whimper, or will you come with me and live?' Katchu, much more sober now, agrees to follow you."
SS_OATAKARK_WARN1	"The trees wave back and forth as the rumbling of the island increases. You wonder if this is the end when the rumbling dies back down to it's normal dull roar.  The volcano looks like it could blow at any time."
SS_OATAKARK_WARN2	"All at once, the island stops shaking. Everything is deathly still. Your first thought is that the island has decided not to tear itself apart after all, but instinctively you know that this terrible silence is the calm before the storm. You should quickly get as far away from the volcano as possible!"
SS_OATAKARK_SINKING	"Suddenly the ground beneath your feet jolts violently, as if the whole island was picked up and dropped. You look to the north and see the island folding into the sea. Your horse is barely able to keep his footing. You tighten your hold on the reins and then turn to the South, the only direction left to go..."
SS_OATAKARK_DROWN_A	"Your terrified horse throws you into the water. A strong undertow threatens to drag you down with the rest of the island, but you fight hard and manage to stay afloat. A piece of driftwood surfaces nearby. Your strength is waning, but you manage to use your belt to fasten yourself to the flotsam before passing out..."
SS_OATAKARK_DROWN_B "You awake to find yourself washed ashore, horseless and alone."
SS_BALLOON_A		"You are about to knock on the door to the large hut when the structure cracks apart to reveal a large, inflating balloon with a basket tied to the bottom. A strangely dressed foreigner peers nervously at you."
SS_BALLOON_B		"As you approach the balloon, the man bellows in a strange accent, 'Beware! I am Foggstaff, Sorcerer of Fire! Come no closer or I will cremate you with my dreadful powers!'"
SS_BALLOON_C		"Then he reaches into his belt pouch and throws a handful of dirt on the ground. A spark flashes and then a small puff of flame rises from the ground.{action[0].text}You are not moved..."
SS_BALLOON_C_K		" Katchu backs off hastily. "
SS_BALLOON_D		"'I have seen gunpowder before, false wizard,' you say. 'Does this balloon of yours fly? If so, I need your aid to escape this island. The lives of a village depend upon it.' Foggstaff removes his peculiar tall, round hat and scratches his head for a moment before conceding."
SS_BALLOON_E		"'Oh dear...  Come aboard then! But watch where you're pointing your weapons or it'll be a long swim ashore for all of us!'"
SS_BALLOON_END_A	"'This is as far as I'll take you!' the foreigner declares. 'As it is, you've already disrupted my schedule. If I don't make it back to England in time, it will be your fault!' You're not sure what he's talking about, but you thank him just the same and then hop out of the basket."  
SS_BALLOON_END_B	"The second your feet touch the ground, the balloon rises up into the sky. High above, Foggstaff leans his head out to wave at you, but his hat is caught by a gust of wind and tumbles into the ocean. You hear a faint 'Damn! My hat...' before the balloon disappears into the clouds."

# Chun Ling and Mountain Pass strings
SS_KAU_PI_A			"This small village, named Kau Pi, is bustling with activity. After asking around you learn that the pass to the south, which allowed horses and carts to get through the mountains, has been closed by a rockslide. The community is working hard to clear the pass, but they say it will take until February."
SS_KAU_PI_B			"If you want to cross now, you will have to abandon your mount. Normally you would never consider such a thing, but your mission is urgent. Do you want to leave your horse behind and continue on foot?"
SS_KAU_PI_B2		"Since you have no horse, you can cross the mountains on foot if you wish."
SS_KAU_PI_RETURN	"The citizens of Kau Pi are busy with the clearing of the pass. It will still take them about {passClear} days to finish."
SS_KAU_PI_PASS_CLEAR	"The village of Kau Pi is relatively quiet now. Everyone must be resting after completing the clearing of the pass."
SS_KAU_PI_REST		"You stop in the mountain village of Kau Pi for a hot meal before continuing your travels."
SS_SARDO_A			"You stop in Sar-do village for a hot meal. The villagers greet you warmly... too warmly. You figure that they must want something from you. You wait patiently, accepting their hospitality, and finally, long after the sun had dipped into the Ocean, the village elder approaches you with a grave expression on his face."
SS_SARDO_B			"He tells you that the islands to the West are haunted with the Moraru Kyonshi, a clan of shape-shifting demons. The villagers have always left them alone, but a couple of brazen youths, not believing the tales, ventured west and have not returned in several months."
SS_SARDO_C			"Another Samurai came to Sar-do a few weeks ago and they asked him to rescue the two boys. But he has not returned. Perhaps you will succeed where he failed..."
SS_SARDO_DONE_A		"The villagers cluster around, all shouting questions at once. You raise your hands for silence and then tell the villagers about your ordeal with the Moraru Kyonshi. Several villagers burst in to tears when you tell them what happened to the youths, but they were pleased to hear that the demons won't harm anyone again."
SS_SARDO_DONE_B		"After your story a party is thrown. For one evening you get caught up in the bliss of the celebration and forget about the duty that hangs over your head. The next morning, you soberly say your goodbyes and depart."
SS_SARDO_REST		"You rest in Sar-do village. The villagers are very friendly and give you free room and a hot meal. You hit the road again feeling completely revived."
SS_KYONSHI			"This village appears to be abandoned."
SS_KYONSHI2			"The village is STILL abandoned. Move on!"
SS_KYONSHI_A		"Upon entering the village, Katchu mentions, 'This is my home village. You're probably wondering why I didn't tell you before. The reason for that will soon be made clear.' The two of you walk until you reach the center of the village. The town square is deserted. Around you, huts stand silent and seemingly empty."
SS_KYONSHI_A_NO_K	"Nobody greets you when you enter this village. Huts stand silent and seemingly empty. Suddenly doors burst open around you and furry, clawed monstrosities emerge from them. Several more of the beasts appear out of nowhere to surround you. Something heavy hits you in the back of the head and everything goes black..."
SS_KYONSHI_B		"Suddenly a door creaks open and through it emerges a furry, clawed monstrosity. You stare in disbelief and then turn to Katchu. He smiles wickedly and then sprouts fur and teeth and claws! Several more of the beasts appear out of nowhere to surround you. Something heavy hits you in the back of the head..."
SS_KYONSHI_C		"You open your eyes and are stung by the sunlight. Your hands are bound tightly to a metal pole behind your back. You struggle in vain to free yourself and then relax a moment to calm your beating head and clear your blurred vision. Eventually you get your bearings. You are in the village square."
SS_KYONSHI_D		"Beside you is Katchu, unconscious and similarly bound. At least you know that he didn't betray you. You yell at him until he awakens. The two of you lay there for hours with no further sign of your captors."
SS_KYONSHI_E		"You hear soft footsteps behind you, but you cannot turn to look. Suddenly the rope binding your hands is cut and you are free. You whirl around, expecting to see a demon but instead you see a young woman dressed in armor. You assume this is the samurai the villagers sent. She must have masqueraded as a male."
SS_KYONSHI_F		"The woman gestures for you to be silent and then leads you out of the village to a concealed cave where you find your equipment. She introduces herself as Chun Ling, before telling her tale: 'I arrived at the deserted village in time to witness the Moraru Kyonshi sacrifice the two boys in homage to the full moon."
SS_KYONSHI_G		"'There was nothing I could do to stop the ceremony, since the demons would have easily overwhelmed me. I stayed hidden in the vicinity, silencing ones that strayed from the group. I've cut their numbers in half, but now they stay in large groups. Together we should be able to defeat the remaining demons.'"

# Gonza and Chikamatsu strings
SS_GONZA_A			"A lone warrior stands outside the tavern, skillfully keeping three samurai at bay with a lance. The three aggressors are surprised by your arrival and the lancer takes the advantage and dispatches two of them with a series of smooth, fast movements. The third samurai attacks the man from behind, leaving a deep wound."
SS_GONZA_B			"The spearman staggers, but brings his weapon around in time to catch his foe in a lunge. The man turns to you with his spear held cautiously at guard. 'I mean you no harm,' you say, and then you tell the warrior of your quest and invite him to join you."
SS_GONZA_C			"The lancer introduces himself as Gonza and explains that he reached his current circumstance by agreeing to wed the daughter of his Lord, Chikamatsu of Bunraku, to better his position, though he was already engaged to the sister of one of his fellow retainers. The fiancée's infuriated brother plotted against Gonza."
SS_GONZA_D			"The brother waited until Chikamatsu was away on a hunting trip, then planted false evidence of Gonza committing an indiscretion with Chikamatsu's wife. Gonza fled, with guards pursuing. He is now trying to reach his lord's hunting lodge, located south and west along the beach, to clear his name. You agree to help him."
SS_AMBUSH_GONZA		"Samurai leap out from {action[0].text}. They wave their katanas menacingly, calling out crude insults to Gonza, and then they attack!"
SS_CHIKAMATSU_A		"A regal looking man, Lord Chikamatsu you presume, emerges from the large hut flanked by two guards. He approaches Gonza and gives him a big hug. Chikamatsu smiles, 'Gonza, my son-to-be! What brings you out here to disturb my vacation?' Gonza tells the story of his betrayal. Chikamatsu's expression gradually darkens."
SS_CHIKAMATSU_B		"When Gonza tells the Lord of your quest, Chikamatsu nods his head to you in respect. The Lord steps back to confer with his two guards. When the conversation is finished, the guards break off into a run to the north. 'I have just sent Chaki and Yano to resolve the problem."  
SS_CHIKAMATSU_C		"'My samurai should bother you no longer. But just to be sure, I will come with you on your quest. You can use an extra sword I presume?'"
SS_CHIKAMATSU_A_NO_G	"At your approach, a regal looking man, Lord Chikamatsu you assume, emerges from the large hut flanked by two bodyguards. You tell him the tragic story of Gonza. Chikamatsu's expression darkens. The Lord steps back to confer with his guards."
SS_CHIKAMATSU_B_NO_G	"When the conversation is finished, the guards break off into a run to the north. 'I have just sent Chaki and Yano to... resolve the problem. To make up for the loss of Gonza, I will join you on your quest. You can use an extra sword I presume?'"
SS_CHIKAMATSU_HORSE	"Chikamatsu offers you his spare horse. You gladly accept. Your sore feet, unaccustomed to walking such great distances, are very grateful."

# J-chan strings
SS_BUNNY		"You come across some curious rabbit tracks leading eastward. The indentation of the prints indicates that they were made by an unusually heavy bunny..."
SS_BUNNY2		"You see more plump bunny tracks continuing southeast..."
SS_BUNNY3		"Here are more eastbound fat bunny tracks. Thoughts of rabbit stew make your stomach rumble..."
SS_JCHAN_A		"After days of following rabbit tracks, you finally catch a glimpse of their originator. It is a cute little black bunny wearing a large rack of horns! Horns or not, the creature looks tasty, so you sneak up and attempt to grab it. It lithely escapes your grasp and darts away. You chase it through the underbrush."
SS_JCHAN_B		"Several minutes of pursuit ensue, ending with the strange rabbit on the edge of a hot spring, cornered, or so you thought. The rabbit leaps into the hot spring and disappears beneath the cloudy water. You search the surface for several minutes, but find no trace of the horned rabbit. 'Can rabbits swim?' you wonder."
SS_JCHAN_C		"Suddenly a dripping-wet arm wraps around your neck and the point of a blade rests against the base of your neck. 'Explain your presence here!' a deep voice demands. You stay calm and relate to your captor the abridged version of your travels."
SS_JCHAN_D		"'You have much honor, but an unfortunate taste for rabbit.' The man says, 'I will allow you to live, and accompany you on your journey, provided you swear to eat no rabbit and ask me no questions.' Lacking any choice in the matter, you swear an oath to eat no rabbit and ask no questions."
SS_JCHAN_E		"The man releases you and introduces himself as J-chan. J-chan is a stark-naked, short, muscular man, with a large, bulbous nose that twitches occasionally. He stops at a hollow tree to collect his clothes and dresses himself before you continue. A hundred questions burn in your mind, but you keep them to yourself."

# Mimoyota and Star Road strings
SS_MIMIYOTA_A		"You find an old man wandering around in the middle of the Jungle. You ask the man if he is lost and he replies, 'We are all lost, but I am capable of finding my way, young warrior. And you?' You ignore the question and offer the man a rice ball. He takes it and begins wolfing it down."
SS_MIMIYOTA_B		"You turn to leave, but the old man places a surprisingly strong arm on your shoulder. 'I am Shigero Mimoyota. You see in me nothing but an old man, but once I was a samurai like you. I abandoned the path of the blade when I discovered my spiritual powers.'"
SS_MIMIYOTA_C		"You start to apologize for your prejudgment, but the old man interrupts, 'I've watched your journey and I knew it would lead you to me. I am the steward of the Star Road and I can take you back to the village of Shichinen. But first, there's something you must do.' Wryly, you think to yourself 'There's always a catch.'"
SS_MIMIYOTA_D		"'Some time ago,' Mimiyota tells you, 'the Star Road was invaded by a powerful demon called the Reswob. Alone I cannot stand against the beast. My magic can counter his, but I am no match for his physical strength. Together, we can defeat him. The Star Road is on the peninsula East of here. Let's go.'"
SS_MIMIYOTA_HEAL	"Mimiyota conducts a long ceremony to bless a rock. After the ceremony, he is exhausted and the rock shines with an eerie light. He passes the rock over the injuries of your party and they are healed!"
SS_STAR_ROAD_A		"Mimiyota waves his hand and the Star Road portal opens. When you step through, colors blur around you until everything is a shade of grey and blue. You find yourself alone in a black void with stars twinkling and swirling overhead. You feel dizzy and very, very small, and you sense that you are falling."
SS_STAR_ROAD_B		"One of the stars is growing larger. You are falling towards it. Soon you pass through the star and everything is white. You close your eyes and see white. When you open them again, you see the blue sky with birds overhead and you realize you're through. Mimiyota congratulates you for not wetting your pants."
SS_RESWOB			"You approach the portal to the Star Road. Suddenly a huge monstrosity steps out from behind the portal to block your way. This creature is unlike any you have seen. Its skin shines like steel, its eyes glow like fire and when it moves it makes a terrible high-pitched whining and hissing sound. This will not be an easy battle..."
SS_STAR_ROAD		"The portal to the Star Road stands here, but an invisible barrier blocks your path."

# End game and Samurai Death strings
SS_SHICHINEN_GREETING	"The villagers of Shichinen greet your arrival with much enthusiasm. You spend the remaining time before the Bandit raid making the village more defensible. Time passes..."
SS_SHICHINEN_RUINED_A	"You arrive at the village to find it abandoned and in ruins. You curse yourself for not making it back in time. Searching the village for signs of life, you find a frightened old woman who tells you the Bandits came, and one of the villagers boasted that they had hired Samurai who would soon be here to defend them."
SS_SHICHINEN_RUINED_B	"The Bandits, enraged that the villagers would try to fight back, set fire to the buildings and enslaved the villagers, taking them to their island to the north."
SS_BANDIT_ATTACK	"The bandits have landed on the North shore and are coming to raid the village. The villagers wish you good luck and then barricade themselves within their homes."
SS_SHICHINEN_FLEE	"You may flee if you wish, but you will be abandoning Shichinen in its hour of need."
SS_BANDITS_DEFEATED	"The village breathes a sigh of relief as the last of the Bandits fall, but you know it is not over. The Bandit leader was not among the groups that you fought. He must be somewhere to the north."
SS_BANDIT_CARRACK	"The bandits' carrack is not being used now that you have slain its owners. You claim it for your own."
SS_BANDIT_LEADER	"The bandit leader sneers at you and says, 'After I have given you foolish Samurai slow, agonizing and shameful deaths, I will do the same to all the villagers of Shichinen.'"
SS_LOSE_GAME		"As you feel your life blood draining out into the earth beneath your broken body, you know you have failed. You did your best and that's all anyone could have expected. You hope the villagers of Shichinen will see it that way."
SS_LOSE_GAME2		"You come across a passerby with news to share. The man tells you that the islands are in an uproar over the total decimation of the village of Shichinen. Aparently the Bandits burned the entire village and sold the surviving villagers into slavery. You have failed!"
SS_TIME_UP			"It has been a year since you accepted the quest to protect the village of Shichinen. You did not make it back in time to protect the village, but if you hurry, perhaps there is more you could do for them."
SS_WIN_GAME			"The bandit leader has fallen! You are victorious!{action[0].text}"
SS_WIN_GAME2		" The villagers are relieved that you rescued them, but they aren't in the mood for celebration. They return to their village to rebuild. "
SS_KATCHU_DROWNS	"Katchu has been swept underwater by the strong tow generated by the sinking island. What a horrible fate! Perhaps it would have been better to leave him to drown in his sorrows in the tavern."
SS_KATCHU_DIES		"Katchu falls in combat. You will miss his fighting prowess and his good cheer, but you won't miss his wretched singing voice."
SS_CHUN_LING_DIES	"Chun Ling has died. She was a nimble warrior and a sure shot with the bow. Her skills will be missed."
SS_GONZA_DIES		"Gonza has died in combat. Such a talented lancer will be sorely missed."
SS_CHIKAMATSU_DIES	"Chikamatsu is knocked off his horse by vile bandits. His horse stumbles and falls over, crushing the life out of him."
SS_JCHAN_DIES		"J-chan crumples to the ground, lethally wounded. He seems to deflate until nothing is left but his clothing. Then from out of the clothing, a large black bunny with horns on its head emerges and quickly darts out of sight."
SS_MIMIYOTA_DIES	"Mimiyota has died! Without his lore you will never gain access to the Star Road, thus you can't return to the village of Shichinen. You have failed in your quest."
SS_MIMIYOTA_DIES2	"Mimiyota has died! The loss of his wisdom and lore will be a severe detriment, but at least he lived long enough to open the portal to the Star Road so that you might complete your quest."

SS_GOSSIP1		"You overhear {action[0].text}{action[1].text} wearing a fur cap bragging to {action[2].text}{action[3].text} about slaying a shape-shifting demon. The {action[1].text} boasts that the cap is made of the demon's skin. It looks more like rabbit fur to you..."
SS_GOSSIP2		"A fight breaks out between {action[0].text}{action[1].text} and {action[2].text}{action[3].text}. The {action[1].text} emerges victorious and buys the loser a drink."
SS_GOSSIP3		"You are approached by {action[0].text}{action[1].text} who recommends that you try the rabbit stew. One whiff of the kitchen makes you decide against it."
SS_GOSSIP4		"Suddenly your nostrils are invaded by a terrible stench. There is a commotion and then {action[0].text}{action[1].text} yells 'It's poison gas! Run!' Everyone quickly leaves. You find out later that it was not poison gas, but rather a chef's failed attempt to make a palatable chocolate protein beverage." 
SS_GOSSIP5		"You are told by {action[0].text}{action[1].text} that some sort of evil, horned rabbit roams the country-side, slaying farm animals and bathing in their warm blood."
SS_GOSSIP6		"'Last night I found my pet pig lying slain in his pen!' exclaims {action[0].text}{action[1].text}. Many of the other patrons make a sign to ward off evil. One says 'The horned demon rabbit has struck again!'"
SS_GOSSIP7_A	"'It was a night dark and cold as Shogun Lau Wang's Moorish concubine,' {action[0].text}{action[1].text} tells a group of listeners. 'I had just put up the lean-to and built a fire when Kato, my traveling companion whom I've known since childhood, grew claws, fangs and bristly hair and attacked me!'"

I never again saw the beast, nor my friend Kato..."
SS_GOSSIP8		"The tavern is abuzz with stories of the sinking of Oatakark. You are told matter-of-factly by {action[0].text}{action[1].text} that the reason the ocean swallowed the island is because the resident fishmongers angered the spirits by charging exorbitant prices for their shellfish."
SS_GOSSIP9		"There is {action[0].text}{action[1].text} standing on a box crying, 'Apart from the isolation, education, sake, public theatre, irrigation, and roads, what have the Shoguns ever done for us?' Everyone just ignores the {action[1].text}."
SS_GOSSIP10		"You are just putting up your feet up when a bag of sand falls through the roof of the tavern, landing on {action[0].text}{action[1].text} standing at the next table. You peer up through the hole in time to see a large balloon floating into the clouds. You think you hear a faint voice saying 'Sorry'"
SS_GOSSIP11		"You are informed by {action[0].text}{action[1].text} that the Star Road is the fastest way to travel anywhere throughout the islands but you will need a guide to find your way."
SS_GOSSIP12		"'I didn't mean any harm,' explains {action[0].text}{action[1].text} 'I jokingly suggested to the old geezer Mimiyota that he give me all his money. He suggested that I was an ass. Next thing I knew, I had gained a tail and an insatiable craving for grass. He rode on my back all the way south into the Jungle!'"
SS_GOSSIP13		"A group of {action[1].text} sing a popular bar song:\n'Fish all day, fish all May, fish all night, fish all right\nSquishy fishy, squishy fishy, I hate fish!\nJust one wish! No more fish! I-HATE-FISH!\nSecond verse, same as first, little bit louder and little bit worse...'"
SS_GOSSIP14		"A group of {action[1].text} sing a popular bar song:\n'Ninety-nine balls of rice on the floor,\n Ninety-nine balls of rice,\n Pick one up, drop in a cup,\n Ninety-eight balls of rice on the floor...'"
SS_GOSSIP15		"A group of {action[1].text} sing a popular bar song:\n'Millet all day, millet all May, millet all night, millet all right\nSpill the millet, spill the millet, we want rice!\nRice is nice! We won't spill it! No more millet! WE HATE MILLET!\nSecond verse, same as first, little bit louder and little bit worse...'"
SS_GOSSIP13_14_15	"You decide against staying for the next verse."
SS_GOSSIP16		"You overhear a wise old monk giving lessons to {action[0].text}{action[1].text}. The monk says 'To learn my teachings, you must first be made to feel much more stupid than I am. Second, you must learn that you cannot learn, imbecile. Third, your ignorance is the path to my self-satisfaction...'"
SS_GOSSIP17		"There is {action[0].text}{action[1].text} here singing a bawdy song about Gaishin, the Glamourous Gaisha."
SS_GOSSIP18		"A peddler here is trying to sell brightly painted 'magic' eggs. The peddler claims that when the egg gestates, out will hatch a little yellow mouse that can shoot lightning bolts. Even if the man is telling the truth, you cannot imagine any use for such a creature."
SS_GOSSIP19		"You overhear {action[0].text}{action[1].text} saying 'The Star Road is closed! I think Mimiyota is keeping it to himself. That greedy old shaman...'"
