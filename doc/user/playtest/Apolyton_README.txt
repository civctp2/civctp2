THIS MATERIAL IS NOT MADE OR SUPPORTED BY ACTIVISION.
This version of the Call To Power 2 is developed by the CTP2 community.

Contact the authors at
https://github.com/civctp2/civctp2/issues

This is the current state of the source code project released for playtesting.
Keep in mind CTP2 is not free. You still need to buy the game.

Playtesters should be aware that these files are intended for a plain vanilla 
install of CTP2. It should also be no problem to install over a patched
version of CTP2, or over a previous playtest version.

In theory this version is now compatible with most of the mods, but special
actions may be required to make them work properly. Please visit the
thread mentioned below and ask if you need more information.

Installation instructions:
Unzip into your CTP2 directory and play. If you get warnings about 
overwriting existing files then you have unzipped to the correct location.
It might be wise, if you have the space available, to make a copy of
your CTP2 directory and unzip this into the copy, so that you can preserve an
unchanged copy for playing mods, etc.

After installation, you can start a new game or continue a game from
a previous version. All you need to do - after loading your save game - is to
open the chat window by typing the apostrophe key (') and enter: /reloadslic
You have to do this once per save game.

For Chinese gamers: If you use a Chinese version of the game you have to
                    first rename your ..\ctp2_data\english\ folder to
                    ..\ctp2_data\chinese\, then unzip the Apolyton Edition
                    over your CTP2 installation, and then edit your
                    ..\ctp2_program\ctp\civpath.txt. This file contains a line
                    saying "english", change it to "chinese".

Please report any problems, bugs, crashes, etc. as an issue on GitHub:
https://github.com/civctp2/civctp2/issues

The latest source code files can be found at: https://github.com/civctp2/civctp2

Visit BureauBert's http://www.ctp2.info/ on how to use some new additions.

This version comes with new tech posters, which are in the same directory as this readme.

Known bugs:

- When you start a new game from a running game than the game put the new game screen in the
middle but does not paint the rest of the screen black so that you left with what was on the
screen before. However, this does not disturb the function.
- The map on the Gaia Controller does not show the coverage over sea.

On Windows:
- The new shield that indicates in the control panel that more than one unit is on a tile does
not display the number of units.

On Linux:
Keyboard issues, at least with a German keyboard.
- The apostrope key (') to open the chat window does not work. Yo can open
the chat window via the menu.
- The secondary enter key on the num pad does not work. Instead use the 
primary big enter key.

Changelog (Well, you don't have to read the full thing. ;)):
2025-01-20 (No revision number we switched to Git)
Fixed:    The flames in the credit screen do not have a black background.
Added:    The GitHub contributors to the ApolytonEdition to the credit screen.
Fixed:    Do not show a border on main map if the tile borders to an
          unexplored tile to not give away that the tile changed the owner
          since you have seen it the last time.
Changed:  Turn the cursor into an erase cursor if the scenario editor is
          in erase mode so that you do not erase anything accidentally that
          you do not want to erase.
Fixed:    Make the erase button in the scenario editor stop erasing when
          you switch it off
Fixed:    Deselect any unit, city, terrain, and terrain improvement switch
          if the erase button is selected in the scenario editor
Fixed:    Do not cities as units on the radar map if they are not known
          by the player.
Fixed:    Show units immediately on the radar map if they were created by

Changed:  Make non-exclusive graphics mode the default on Windows DirectX.
Changed:  Play a pirated route sound even if the position from that the
          the sounds come is under the fog of war. The player simply gets
          a message that the route was pirated and so a sound is adequate, too.
Fixed:    Do not play sounds that come from positions the player does not,
          either because the position is unexplored or is under the fog of war.
Fixed:    A crash when clicking on the top border of an empty list box.
Changed:  Increase the distance of cities the AI connects with roads so
          that cities that can be connected via road within its boarders
          are indeed connected.
Fixed:    Cities founded after the lunch of Globe Sat are also revealed to
          the Globe Sat owner.

          more important cities and waits until it has built more units.

          and garrison units can only be used for city defense.

Fixed:    The AI also uses units on board of a ship for its goals.

Fixed:    The AI uses the most exploitive slider settings as long as the
          people are happy enough.

          since 10 turns must pass so that receptions can be hold again.
Changed:  The AI ignores trespassing for Diplomats, so that it can build
          embassies. Trespassing with diplomats is not considered a
          violation anyway.

Fixed:    Freed slaves go to random cities, so that they do not starve in
          overcrowded cities.
Fixed:    When slaves uprise, the city population is reduced by the number
          of slaves units that died during a battle.

Changed:  The unit panel shows a shield if there are more than one unit
          unit in different armies on the field. You can click the shield
          for details. Works in that case like the next unit button.
          If there is only one army with more than one unit it shows the details.
          The shield also shows the number of units on Linux, however the number
          is missing in the Windows version.
Changed:  The next unit button does not try to select multiple units if
          only one unit is on the tile.

2011-06-12 (Revision 1111)
Fixed:    The game does not crash, if a city is supposed to be converted and the
          converting unit was killed the turn before.
Fixed:    The AI does not try to disband settlers anymore.
Fixed:    After a reload, the correct strategy is loaded for the AI.
Fixed:    The AI does not use units for garrison if they are not needed. This
          frees troops for other tasks.
Fixed:    Thread and power calculation have been corrected so that the AI does
          not waste resources to fulfill its tasks.
Fixed:    The AI does not hunt enemy units far away from home, just because one
          has been seen by a spy.

          armies to other tasks, so that the original task can still be
          fulfilled.
Fixed:    The AI ungroups stealth units from non-stealth units if their goal

          picking those first that are closest to most of its units.

          and the upgraded unit should be able to carry cargo.
Added:    Added Chinese text files.
Fixed:    The AI uses transporters even if a target is on the same continent
          but cannot reached, because for instance the way is blocked.
Fixed:    The AI conquers cities if it has a big stack adjacent to that city
          representing 2/3 of the needed power. This is no problem since the
          needed power is calculated with some buffer.

          time.
Fixed:    If a goody hut gives an advance then EitherPrerequisite and Prerequisite
          are now checked whether a player can have an advance.

          not just the veteran boni.

          almost all its cities to the wonder building list.
Added:    Added for each AI personality an island strategy, that will use an
          island specific advance list.
Restored: The Penicillin wonder now does what it did in the original game.
Changed:  The graphics are now drawn on a back buffer this removes drawing
          artifacts and saves your eyes.
Added:    The minimap has a button to show you the players' capitals.
Added:    The minimap has a button to show your relations with other

          you do not know, and red is for those you are at war with.
Fixed:    Fixed a problem with AI transporter handling, that also may lead to
          a crash.
Fixed:    Fixed a problem when fort vision is removed because the tile under it
          had died.
Fixed:    The drawing system does not try to use an invalid memory pointer,

          handles it properly.
Fixed:    The AI does not try to use boats that cannot reach the target continent.

          tiles are already controlled by other cities.
Fixed:    The messages for nano infected and nano destroyed cities address
          now the victim player and do not throw slic errors anymore.
Changed:  The main map city icons for bio infection, nano infection, injoin
          and happiness attack now show the civilization color of the attacker.
Fixed:    The feat that is supposed to give extra science now gives extra
          science.

Added:    More of the government modified functionality for buildings and
          wonders was implemented.
Fixed:    The AI regard for another player is recomputed when first contact
          is made. This prevents the AI to give the human player a map exchange,
          a peace treaty, etc. on the first turn of contact. Now the human player
          has to build up trust, first.

2009-05-17 (Revision 981)
Fixed:    The AI does not try to use units for conquest if those units were
          assigned for city garrison. Such a attack does not fail anymore.
Fixed:    Cell unit strength computation was fixed so that the AI knows how
          much units it needs to conquer your cities.
Changed:  The empire manager now shows the actual numbers used for rations and
          wages.
Changed:  The original gameplay was restored, including terrain, units, elite
          units were disabled, and the trade bonus through cities was removed.
Changed:  Upgrade paths now match those of the original Apolyton Pack mod.
Fixed:    The Great Library now shows the right information about terraforming.
Fixed:    Active defense was added to the units destroyer, plasma destroyer,
          leviathan, morey striker, and interceptor to match the Great Library.
Changed:  "Smooth borders" option graphics to just show thicker borders so they
          are more visible than the original.
Fixed:    Trenches are generated again when a map is created and if
          PERCENT_TRENCH in Const.txt is zero. PERCENT_TRENCH is set to zero
          until we have converted the CTP1 trenches to CTP2 trenches.

          line units of a defending army will use their defense stat (rather
          than attack) to attack the front line units of the attacking army.
Changed:  Units with defense > 0 but attack = 0 no longer die immediately, and
          will at least defend themselves. If New Combat rule is enabled they
          will also counter-attack in a battle. Only an army that contains units
          all with attack = 0 and defense = 0 will die immediately.
Added:    The slic functions CreateBuilding and CreateWonder were added. The
          difference with events  with same name is that these functions do
          not effect stored production in a city. And unlike the CreateWonder event,
          CreateWonder function does not trigger a wonder movie.
Added:    "City Land Attack", "City Air Attack" and "City Sea Attack" where
          added to the battleview window to show these the city building
          bonuses during battle.
Fixed:    Many unit bonuses used in combat that were not working at all before.
Added:    Added the slic function UnitMovementLeft(unit). It returns an integer 
          of the unit's movement remaining. 100 = 1 move, 33 = a single road move etc.
Fixed:    ActiveDefence to only fire when there's a valid target and still alive.
          This removes the exploit of making a full army of active-defender's
          waste their active defense on one unit.
Removed:  Counter-bombard and counter-active-defense units do not fire anymore
          after an active defender has fired, this removes the big disadvantage
          of being the defender, and it was very cheesy to look at.
Fixed:    Units that have Attack=0 cannot attack anymore even if they have the
          "CanAttack" flag (Cyber Ninja for example).
Changed:  Bombard so bombarding units and defenders use same bonuses
          (such as terrain defense, veteran etc) as they do in normal combat.
Fixed:    The GetNeedsIrrigation flag now finds irrigation squares next to a city
          with a irrigation source of another tile improvement.

          detailed information, and displays yet researched researched
          governments so that you can compare them with your current government.
Changed:  The AI goal calculation is now also unit dependent and the AI was
          sped up.
Changed:  The city manager was redesigned to display all information from the
          tabs in one window.
Added:    Some tile graphics and all the rules for submarine canyon/trench
          tiles were added.
Changed:  The UpgradeTo flag does not obsolete units anymore.
Fixed:    The game does not hang anymore if the AI tries to load a transporter
          that cannot move to its load position.
Added:    A random map settings option was added to the map settings window.
Fixed:    The "activate" and "disband" buttons in the city manager will be
          after disbanding a unit.
Changed:  The diplomacy manager and diplomacy proposal window were resized to
          fit on 600 pixels high resolution again. The width of the proposal
          window were increased and its layout were modified, for easier
          modification later.
Fixed:    The Diplomat photo now shows up when the AI sent you a proposal.
Changed:  The advance options window was cleaned by removing options already
          present in other windows. Also other option windows were cleaned up.
Added:    A Custom start and end ages option was added to single-player rules
          screen.
Fixed:    The map does not auto-center on moving stealth units that you can't see.
Changed:  Elite medal icon now replaces veteran medal icon, rather than sitting
          below it.
Changed:  No units can be expelled from a tile anymore if there is at least one
          unit that cannot be expelled.
Fixed:    The AI uses any units inside a newly founded city for garrison.
Changed:  The AI uses less units for city garrison for the higher higher 
          defense levels. This is closer to the original game.
Changed:  An enemy transporter does not show the cargo icon anymore if it only
          carries stealth units.
Fixed:    If you click on a hidden enemy stealth unit or on another kind of 
          unit or city inside the fog of war your units or cities will
          deselected.
Changed:  Slic event debug messages are now off by default.
Added:    The AI will free slaves when it conquers a city if it neither owns 
          slaves nor it has any slavers.
Fixed:    The AI builds caravans again.
Fixed:    Rare crash at start-up (race condition with mouse initialization).
Fixed:    The game does not crash anymore if the riot casualties option is used.
Changed:  The map does not center on a pirate event if AutoCenter is off.

2008-10-08 (Revision 907)
Fixed:    The tile highlight square at the mouse pointing position does not
          blink anymore. In general, blinking items draw attention even if
          there is nothing important. In that case it was blinking always at
          the of the GUI repainting speed, which just makes the player tired.
Fixed:    The AI now uses the right settle city bounding rectangle for settling.
Changed:  The AI only considers a city in its goal assignment as unexplored if
          no tile improvement is visible. That is the same way as a human player
          behaves, since if he sees a tile improvement without a city then he
          concludes it must be in the dark.
Added:    Extra upgrade command for the order button bank. The upgrade command
          has to be enabled before the game start from special rules screen.
          The upgrade command button is only visible if an army is active
          that contains an upgradable unit.
Fixed:    The AI does rebuild its capitol if it has lost its capitol.
Fixed:    The ration, workday, and wages sliders now add happiness, even if
          the overall slider happiness is positive. This behavior is the 
          expected one, even if the programmers capped the total increase,
          originally.
Changed:  Cities are now watchful for seven turns like in Cradle, so that
          slavers go more to other cities.
Changed:  If the AI build for offense it builds city walls first. Makes its
          defense stronger and protects from slavery.
Fixed:    Slaves do not go to cities if those cities are at the population
          maximum.
Fixed:    Slave raid failure message now displays the target city correctly.
Fixed:    Slavers do not go to cities with walls.
Fixed:    The AI does not consider boats with cargo as defenders although
          the cargo cannot defend. (e.g. Slavers)
Changed:  Cleaned up various AI code files to improve code reliability and
          speed.
Fixed:    The game does not crash anymore if a new civilization has the same
          player number that was used by a civilization killed previously.
Fixed:    A crash while the game checked whether a unit can settle.
Changed:  Instead of moving units first to a goal and then canceling the goal
          if it has not enough units when the units were already moved, it now
          does not send its units to those goals at all.

  but at least they work now as expected.

  have the right size as displayed in the CityPopSpinner and keep their style given 
  by the Scenario Editor.

  algorithm.

  left from completion.

  improvements, even if you are short on PW. To activate this option, you have to edit

  There is no in-game screen to modify this setting (not yet).
Fixed: AI-AI-Diplomacy actually happen now.
Added: Two new flags for the TerrainDB to allow modders to customize the graphics for 
  goody huts, this modification allows the modder to define for each terrain a 
  different hut graphic, for example you could have glacier like style huts for icy 
  terrains or a dessert or oasis like ruin/hut for desserts and so on. The new flags 
  in the TerrainDB are optional if both of these flags are missing or just one of them 
  a default image is used, like it is in the original CTP2. The terrain.txt here is a 
  modified version, I replaced some of the ruins graphics with another graphic that is 
  part of the tile file already. This terrain.txt is meant as a base for discussion, 
  so far it just demonstrated that it does work.
Added: The maximum city size that you can create with the scenario editor is now 999.
Added: Flat Map and Neptune World option to the single player shape selection window. 
  This new features are only available in a single player game so far.

Fixed: Do not overwrite the user's leader name with the default civilisation-dependent 
  name when there is no reason to.
Fixed: Do not trigger a disaster warning when there is no pollution at all.
Fixed: Some Hotseat issues with hiding information between players.
Implemented: SLIC functions GetRoundsToNextDisaster and GetCurrentPollutionLevel.
Added: Close message boxes automatically when clicking the eyepoint.
  A line CloseOnEyepoint=No will be added to userprofile.txt when you start a game with 
  the modified source. You have to change No to Yes to activate this option. 
  There is no in-game screen to change this setting.
