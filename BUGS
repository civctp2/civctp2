- The text in text controls is the wrong size (see HACK message in
  ui/aui_common/aui_textfield.cpp)
- Something in the CD code generates an 'Operation not permitted' message
  whenever there is a CD in the drive, and a 'No medium found' message when
  there isn't (I suspect the CD music-related code)
- The intro movie doesn't play
- It is necessary to click somewhere after the 'Loading' dialog to reach the
  main menu (this is probably related to the intro movie, since the problem
  goes away when the 'nointromovie' argument is passed to ctp2)
- No screen resolution options appear in the graphics options
- I get a message saying 'open /dev/sequencer: No such device' during startup,
  even though /dev/sequencer does exist on my machine
- When trying to start a network game, the game freezes whilst searching for
  servers and is very difficult to kill
- There are frequent minor graphics glitches, including:
  - The cursor colours are messed up
  - The colours of the city improvement picutures (but not those of units or
    wonders) are similarly messed up
  - On the credits screen the flames are framed by black boxes, rather than the
    background showing through -- this is probably some kind of alpha channel
    problem
  - The drawing of map tiles isn't working properly (although it *does* work
    properly when under the fog of war)
  - Pixels have a tendency to be shifted around by the cursor - I feel this is
    another symptom of whatever problem is causing the cursor colours to be
    mesed up.
  - The numbers along the path that shows when a unit is being given a move
    order are missing
  - There are sometimes gaps in the lines on the ranking graphs
- The game uses a lot of CPU all the time
- The window of the game has no title
- Keyboard input doesn't work
- The mousewheel does nothing
- If only the first map plugin is loadable, then the game gets stuck in an
  infinite loop when creating a new game
- The SDL keyboard support assumes that the user has a British keyboard
