The build and install process evolved without much design, and 
needs a bit of work.  This file is a quick intro that glosses over
the ugly details; determined programmers can figure out more by looking
at the batch files and makefiles in the source tree.

Compiling:

To compile the game SDK and server on linux on Intel, run 'make'.
This creates and populates the linux86 directory, and the following archives:
	linux86.tgz - the binary SDK plus all the servers
	anet3srv.tgz - just the game server
	anetcmon.tgz - just the crash monitor server
	anetmon.tgz - just the game server status monitor server

To compile the game SDK on Windows, run src/build.bat.
This creates the win directory.  This has not been
tested lately, and requires both MSVC 4.2 or later and a few odd tools
like 'wmake', probably from Watcom C.  T

To compile the game SDK on MacOS, use the CodeWarrior project in 
src/mac/macbuild.sit.

Installing:

To install the SDK under Linux, copy h/anet.h, h/aneterr.h and
h/anet_types.h and unpack linux86.tgz onto the machine where you want
to build games.

To install the SDK under Windows, copy h/anet.h, h/aneterr.h,
h/anet_types.h and the win directory onto the machine where you want
to build games.

To install the game server, see 
src/linux/server/README2.html and doc/testing.html.
