<h1><center>The Anet Game Server</center></h2>
<p>
The <b>Anet game server</b> is a place where people playing over the 
Net can find opponents, chat, and launch games.
It is accessed directly by the game, and sometimes also by a Web browser.
It consists of a program which we distribute free of charge to Internet Service 
Providers and other interested parties.
An up to date list of all servers is maintained by a master server,
and is downloaded by the Anet library when users connect to any game
server.
<p>
The server executable is part of the Linux version of the Anet SDK.
The intrepid game programmer may run his or her own game server
and/or score server during development; contact Dan Kegel for more info.
<p>
The current version of the server acts mostly as a player-matching
service; Anet games use Anet Game Servers as gathering
places for people starting or joining games.
In addition, the following features were being worked on 
in 1998-1999, and are in various stages of completion:
<ul>
<li> Robustness: a load test application (not yet included!?)
can simulate hundreds of typical users, can be used to verify 
that the game servers can give good
service to users even when being pounded by a large number of users.

<li> Authentication: users will log in to the server when they first access it;
this generates marketing data, lets the server notify people when their 
buddies log in, and gives the server a username to tally player scores under.

<li> Score reporting: when players kill opponants or achieve mission
objectives during play, these events are reported to the server, which 
relays them to a central database.  
Players are then ranked by score at the game vendor's web site.  (The notion of
score can be defined differently for each game, at the game designer's 
discretion.)
</ul>
<h2>Current Anet Game Servers</h2>
A status page which gathers info about all the servers can be
run on any web server; see ../src/linux/anetmon.
<p>
Some info about individual servers is available from the servers themselves,
usually at the url http://servername/anet2.
