<h1>Building / installing / testing the Anet Server</h1>

<ul>
<li> Build everything by typing "make" on the command line.

<li> Follow the instructions found in "linux86/server/README2.txt"
  to install and run a game server.

<li> Run gtest (found in "demo/gtest/normal"), with the following 
  command line options, to connect to a game server:
<pre>
		gtest -p:IPADR -t:SPECIES -n:DLL
</pre> 
  where IPADR is the IP address of the machine running the game server,<br>
  SPECIES is the id of the game lobby (if you don't care, just use 1000),<br>
  and DLL is the network transport DLL (under Linux, this is ignored unless
  you have Loki's transport patch).
<p>
  (Note: "localhost" will not work for the IP address -- you must use
  the public IP address as seen by clients!  See
  server/README2.txt for more details).  

<li> Once you have succeeded in running gtest and connecting to a game server,
  create a new session using the host command in gtest (i.e. "host foo 8" 
  will create a new session with name foo and 8 maximum players).

<li> Run another instance of gtest in another window, and connect to the same 
  game server and with the same species you used earlier.  Then type 
  "sessions" in the new window; you should see the name of the new session 
  you just created.  If you can see your new session (in the new window of 
  course), then all is well and good, otherwise the test failed.

<li> If the first test succeeded, try adding and deleting players (with the 
  "newplayer" and "delplayer" commands, respectively) to the session 
  from both windows and make sure the changes are shown in each window.  
  Make sure you join the session created in the host window by using 
  the join command in the client window (i.e. "join foo").  You may also 
  want to try changing the names of some players using the "setpname" 
  command.  When deleting players from a session, the host can delete 
  any player; however, a client can only delete players that it has 
  created.  In addition, each client, as well as the host, can add up 
  to four players for a given session.  More information on gtest can be 
  found in "doc/gtest.htm".

<li> To test the game server with a real game, obtain and install an 
  Anet game that supports multiplayer internet game play.  Then: 

<ol>
<li> Search for the session type (or Species) of your game in the file 
   "types.txt", located in the game server etc/ directory.

<li> Then connect to your game server via gtest with the session type 
   you just found (i.e. "Civilization: Call to Power" has session type 
   73).

<li> Create a new session (i.e. "host foo 8").

<li> Declare the session to be a server lobby by typing "lobby".

<li> Connect to your game server via your Anet game.

<li> Join the lobby you declared at step 3 (via your Anet game).

<li> Create new players and delete players via gtest for the session 
   created in step 3; and make sure you can see those changes in your 
   Anet game.

</ol>
</ul>

<h2>Making your server available to the world</h2>
Games have an internal hardcoded list of master game servers.
Once they connect to one of those servers, they suck down a list
of all known game servers, and store it in the file servers.dat
(the location on disk varies from game to game).  There are two ways
to make your server known to the world:
<ul>
<li>Get your server added to a popular Anet server's list of game
servers.  (See server/README2.txt, part 5a.)
Then when people connect to that Anet server, their servers.dat
file will be updated with your server's address.

<li>Using gtest, create a servers.dat file containing your server's address,
and post it on a web site together with instructions telling users
how to download it and overwrite their existing servers.dat with it.

To create the servers.dat file, put your game server in its own list
of servers (servers.txt), restart the server, connect to it using gtest,
and give the 'gameservers' command.  Once you see your server in that list,
and quit gtest, it writes out the 'servers.dat' file you need.
</ul>

<h2>Additional Notes:</h2>

<ul>
<li> Game server types (or Species) for specific Anet games can be 
  found in the file "types.txt" located in the game server etc/ directory.

<li> You can make permanent entries to the files "names.txt, "servers.txt", 
  "apps.txt", and "types.txt" by putting those desired entries in the 
  files "local-names.txt", "local-severs.txt", "local-apps.txt", and 
  "local-types.txt", respectively.

<li> 
Anet does not like running on machines with multiple IP addresses.
Under Linux, you can get around this by using the UUDP_ADDRESS environment 
variable to tell Anet which IP address to use.  Under Windows, you should
avoid running Anet servers or clients on machines that have more than
one IP address (e.g. machines acting as Internet Sharing gateways).
