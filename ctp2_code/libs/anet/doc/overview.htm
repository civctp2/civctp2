<h1><center>Anet: A Network Game Programming Library</center></h2>
<center>Last updated: 22 August 1998</center>
<h2>A Rose by Any Other Name...</h2>
The public name for Activision's online game service was ActiveLink.
It is referred to by Anet in this doc, and by ActiveNet in some places 
in the code.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
Anet was designed to help multiplayer games reach the widest possible 
audience, lets users play against the widest possible choice of opponents
online.
<p>
It supports many kinds of connections: LAN, Internet, modem, direct serial 
connection, and even <a href="services.htm">proprietary gaming networks</a> such as 
<a href="http://www.heat.net/">Heat</a>,
<a href="http://www.mplayer.com">MPlayer</a>,
<a href="http://www.zone.com">Microsoft Game Zone</a> and
<a href="http://www.dwango.com/">Dwango</a>. 
(All of these are gone as of 2001 except the Zone.)

<h2>What is Anet?</h2>
Anet has three main parts:
<ul>
<li>An <a href="server.htm">Internet game server</a> where people playing over the Net can find 
opponents.  The game server is a program which we can distribute free of
charge, and will be run by major Internet Service Providers and hobbyists;
a tracker program will maintain an up to date list of
all servers.
<li>An <b>API</b> (like Microsoft's DirectPlay or 
Apple's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/dev/games/">NetSprocket</a>) which takes care of the 
dirty part of networking (like dialing the modem or connecting over the 'Net),
and lets the game programmer concentrate on the game.  
<li>A client program, or shell, which lists all of the games currently being
played on the server (MercNet, Dark Reign, etc.), lets players chat with 
each other before choosing a game, and then launches the appropriate game.
(This part is optional; each game can be played without the client program.
It is the only part that has not yet been shipped with a product.)
</ul>
<h2>What platforms are supported?</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Windows 95</b><br>
About eight products have been shipped using Win95 Anet.  
Special effort was taken to make sure that porting games between
Microsoft's game networking library and Anet is reasonably easy.
<li><b>Linux</b><br>
Linux is used for our game servers, and as a result, a Linux version
of the Anet library is available.  Only the Internet transport
is supported on Linux.
<li><b>Macintosh</b><br>
One shipping product, Mac Netmech, uses an older version of the SDK.
Support for this platform could be revived if desired.
<li><b>Java</b><br>
The Java support is experimental.
It's implemented as a wrapper around the native library.
Right now, it's only implemented for Windows 95.
<li><b>DOS</b><br>
One product (DOS MercNet) is shipping with Anet support built in,
but it is unlikely anyone will want this version of the SDK, so we no longer
support it.
</ul>
<h2>Will Anet games work with online services like TEN and Mpath?</h2>
Yes - it's pretty easy!  All it takes is for the
game to be able to use our <a href="services.htm">commandline launcher</a>.
<h2>What does Anet look like to the Programmer?</h2>
To get started using Anet, the programmer needs
the Anet SDK, usually distributed as ANETSDK.ZIP.
<p>
Refer to the <a href="index.html">top-level documentation index</a>
for programmer information.
includes pointers to the
<a href="dp.htm">Anet API Overview and Function Reference</a>, which
explains how to use Anet in a game, and 
<a href="../demo">the demo applications</a>.
<p>
The program <a href="gtest.htm">gtest</a> is provided with the SDK
as a tool for the programmer to play with the API interactively
and learn how it behaves without having to compile any C programs.
<h2>Developer Support</h2>
Developers should <a href="mailto:dank-anet@kegel.com">contact 
Dan Kegel</a> for support and additional example code if needed.
Often just a couple minutes talking over questions can save a great deal
of time.
