 Memory allocation functions used by DP.

 Include in any dp*.c file that wants to call malloc, e.g.
   assoctab.c dp.c dpio.c dppv.c dynatab.c q.c

 This lets us override the allocator in different environments if
 malloc won't do.

 $Log: dpmem.h $
 Revision 1.4  1997/07/10 19:13:15  dkegel
 Use predefined _WIN32 symbol rather than special WIN32 symbol.
 Revision 1.3  1997/05/29 19:42:12  dkegel
 Switch to stdlib.h to get malloc(); more portable.
 Revision 1.2  1997/03/09 03:04:19  dkegel
 Tell Windows it can move the block when reallocating if it needs to.
 Revision 1.1  1997/03/07 19:35:29  dkegel
