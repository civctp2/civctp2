 Private packet definitions for the dp multiplayer networking layer.
 $Log: dppkt.h $
 Revision 1.31  1997/08/23 20:47:01  dkegel
 1. Added dp_LEAVE_PACKET_ID
 2. Added dpSendLeaveSession() and dpHandleLeaveSession()
 3. Added code in dpClose() to more thoroughly undo dpOpen()
 Revision 1.30  1997/08/19 22:04:57  dkegel
 Player system now preallocates a block of id's for each host.
 Revision 1.29  1997/08/18 01:48:49  dkegel
 Added in a couple dp2 packets.
 Revision 1.28  1997/06/13 22:57:57  geychaner
 Added FIN_PACKET_ID for active close FIN packet
 Revision 1.27  1997/05/31 22:42:21  dkegel
 Moved 'pragma pack' to dp*pack*.h for portability.
 Revision 1.26  1997/04/25 18:24:48  dkegel
 Added dpTurn stuff.
 Revision 1.25  1997/03/01 02:57:11  dkegel
 Added dp_SERVER_LOGOUT_PACKET_ID as kludge until active close implemented.
 Revision 1.24  1997/02/27 01:51:25  dkegel
 THE BIG REARRANGEMENT: split public API into anet.h; dp.h and dppkt.h
 remain for those who need the full API including the real dp_t;
 care must be taken to avoid circular includes and to avoid activating
 too much of anet.h when using the full API.
 Revision 1.23  1997/02/26 23:05:18  dkegel
 Moved pv_user_playerData_packet_t to dppkt.h as dp_user_ etc.
 Revision 1.22  1997/02/17 07:57:02  dkegel
 New size limit defines: dp[io]_MAXLEN_[UN]RELIABLE
 Revision 1.21  1997/02/17 06:09:25  dkegel
 Corrected packet length upper bounds to match real limits.
 Fragile; size of headers & envelopes is hardcoded to avoid circular
 references.
 Revision 1.20  1997/02/16 03:59:16  dkegel
 1. Added sessionKarma to dp_group_t because I'm sending it
 instead of dp_groupId_t for addgroup packet.
 2. Reduced max group members to dp_MAXREALPLAYERS for same reason.
 Revision 1.19  1997/02/16 01:41:32  dkegel
 Added one more alias for flags field of dp_session_t.
 Revision 1.18  1997/02/12 21:37:53  dkegel
 Added host migration message.
 Revision 1.17  1997/02/12 03:07:02  dkegel
 1. Added sessionKarma to group packets as insurance against bogus packets.
 2. Added SYN packet for starting reliable session.
 Revision 1.16  1997/02/10 07:46:17  dkegel
 1. Moved some definitions (dp_FAR, etc) in from dp.h for benefit of dpdll.
 2. Renamed rdp_ stuff to dpio_.
 Revision 1.15  1997/02/05 02:21:46  dkegel
 Added an alias in dp_playerId_t for the benefit of the other library's
 createplayer message.
 Revision 1.14  1997/02/04 04:18:44  dkegel
 1. Use the DP_ALIAS macro to declare anonymous unions; less cluttered,
 lets them be disabled when compiling with Gnu C, which doesn't support
 them.
 2. Added a few more aliases to support porting from the other library.
 Revision 1.13  1997/01/31 07:47:41  dkegel
 Settled the structure packing question by using
 #pragma pack(x) / #pragma pack() pairs at top and bottom of
 all .h files that declare structures.  Was careful to put
 #pragma pack(x) after last #include (to avoid wierd nesting effects
 due to lack of #pragma pack(pop).
 Revision 1.12  1997/01/30 01:58:25  dkegel
 1. Partially implemented player groups.
 2. Use anonymous unions (yech) to allow old programs to access
 elements of structures by the names used in the other library.
 Revision 1.11  1997/01/08 21:56:55  dkegel
 Player handles now long!
 Revision 1.10  1996/12/18 18:20:27  administrator
 Change to c style comments for benefit of gcc.
 Revision 1.9  1996/12/18 18:05:41  administrator
 1. Put PACK after every member of a structure that gets sent over the wire;
 see dp.h.
 2. Moved hMaster out of dp_session_t, as it changed sizes, and didn't
 really need to be sent; see dp.h.
 Revision 1.8  1996/10/10 23:12:00  dkegel
 Added support for dpPingUser().
 Revision 1.7  1996/10/10 18:45:38  dkegel
 Added offsets of more packet elements for benefit of game server.
 Revision 1.6  1996/09/25 22:48:16  dkegel
 1. Support the notion of unreachable hosts.  In particular, dpEnumSessions()
 will return dp_RES_HOST_NOT_RESPONDING if the game server is unreachable.
 2. Export dpSetGameServer(), and extend it so that one may clear the game
 server by passing it NULL.
 Revision 1.5  1996/09/13 01:16:00  dkegel
 Implemented PLOSSCTR define to dump packet loss summary at dpDestroy
 time.  Will get common.mif to obey PLOSSCTR= switch on cmdline.
 Revision 1.4  1996/09/08 23:05:31  dkegel
 Made dp_species_t unsigned, for the benefit of game server code running on
 unix machines.
 Revision 1.3  1996/08/26 21:31:05  dkegel
 dp->s.maxPlayers is now updated continuously.
 Revision 1.2  1996/07/23 22:08:37  dkegel
 Commented out #define SPARC because most programs compiled with this are on
 pc.
 Revision 1.1  1996/07/23 00:33:06  dkegel
 Initial revision
