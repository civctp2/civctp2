 ActiveNet Transport DLL loading functions.
 $Log: dpdll.h $
 Revision 1.5  1997/07/27 22:56:00  dkegel
 Now methods of dpio rather than dp.  That way they can store
 things in the dpio_t, which is good for two reasons:
 1. it lets us get away from statics if we like
 2. it lets us save things across freeze-thaw cycles (like OS comm handles)
 Revision 1.4  1997/02/27 02:32:36  dkegel
 Moved public definitions from dpdll.h into anet.h
 Revision 1.3  1997/02/27 01:51:23  dkegel
 THE BIG REARRANGEMENT: split public API into anet.h; dp.h and dppkt.h
 remain for those who need the full API including the real dp_t;
 care must be taken to avoid circular includes and to avoid activating
 too much of anet.h when using the full API.
 Revision 1.2  1997/02/12 23:25:48  dkegel
 Oops.
