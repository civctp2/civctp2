/*------- Player Variables -------------------------------------------------
 Each player (or group) can have 0 or more data elements associated with it.
 These are available automatically to all players in the session.
 If desired, they can be made available to players not in the session.
 (This might be done with a data element indicating mission or vehicle name.)

 The system reserves the first few tags for its own use, so
 games should only use tags dp_PLAYERDATA_KEY_USERDEF through
 dp_PLAYERDATA_KEY_MAX.

 Example uses:
 * Player's long name (set dp_PLAYERDATA_FLAG_PUBLIC to give lobby access)
 * Custom vehicle or logos
 * Gross position and damage data
 * Game secrets (the password for my fortress is SPAM)
 * Voice taunts
 * Downloadable mission filename and checksum
 * Downloadable missions (set dp_PLAYERDATA_FLAG_NOFLOOD); first call
   to dpGetPlayerData for that key starts the retrieval.

 (See also Linda http://www.sca.com, a more powerful virtual shared memory
  system.  Our system only allows 'triplets' where the
  first two members are the player id and the key number, and the third
  is the payload data; Linda is a bit more general.  Linda also blocks
  if you try to read a variable that isn't set yet, which we can't do,
  since we're single-threaded.)

 $Log: dppv.h $
 Revision 1.6  1997/05/31 22:42:22  dkegel
 Moved 'pragma pack' to dp*pack*.h for portability.
 Revision 1.5  1997/02/26 23:04:56  dkegel
 Moved pv_user_playerData_packet_t to dppkt.h as dp_user_ etc.
 Revision 1.4  1997/02/25 01:42:38  dkegel
 1. Player variables now preserved across freeze/thaw cycles.
 2. pv_get now supports getting just the length by passing NULL buffer.
 Revision 1.3  1997/02/23 05:51:38  dkegel
 Rewrote to use pv_update instead of sending everything immediately.
 Should be much more robust.
