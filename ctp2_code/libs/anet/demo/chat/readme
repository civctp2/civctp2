BUILD.BAT will compile both the chat program and its installer.


Compiling the Installer:
Files to be compiled are in setupsrc dir.
Files in the setup directory are used when running install program.

Modify setup.rul script in the setupsrc dir if you'd like.
If you need to add files, they must be added both in setup.rul and
(see SmallFileTransfer()) and in setup.lst (God knows why).

Build.bat will copy the output of the compile to the setup directory;
the setup directory is what would appear on the root of the
distribution floppy.


Running the installer:
Just run setup.exe as usual.  It will install chat.exe and the
needed DLL's into \demochat by default.


Running gtest .bat files:
There are comments at the beginning of each .bat file describing what they do.

Example of how to run:
run hostg.bat first on one machine
then when gtest from hostg.bat file sleeps, run clientch.bat immediately on
 the other machine
