 Subject: [51] I need a CRC algorithm

 As its name implies (Cyclic Redundancy Check) a crc adds redundancy whereas
 the topic of this group is to remove it. Yet this question comes up often in
 comp.compression.

 The file ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/clients/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt is a pretty
 comprehensive description of the whole CRC concept, including a C program.

 - Schwaderer W.D., "CRC Calculation", April 85 PC Tech Journal, pp.118-133.
 - "Calculating CRCs by Bits and Bytes", BYTE Magazine, September 1986
 - Ramabadran T.V., Gaitonde S.S., "A tutorial on CRC computations", IEEE
   Micro, Aug 1988.
 - the source of all archivers, such as the file makecrc.c in the Info-ZIP
   sources (see extension .zip in item 2)

 The following C code (by Rob Warnock <rpw3@sgi.com>) does CRC-32 in
 BigEndian/BigEndian byte/bit order.  That is, the data is sent most
 significant byte first, and each of the bits within a byte is sent most
 significant bit first, as in FDDI. You will need to twiddle with it to do
 Ethernet CRC, i.e., BigEndian/LittleEndian byte/bit order. [Left as an
 exercise for the reader.]

 The CRCs this code generates agree with the vendor-supplied Verilog models
 of several of the popular FDDI "MAC" chips.
