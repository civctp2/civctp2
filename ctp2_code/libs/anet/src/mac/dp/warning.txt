This code is meant to be compiled with Codewarrior on either Mac or Win95.
To compile with Codewarrior on Win95, use the project file in this directory.
To compile with Codewarrior on Mac, use the project file in ..\macbuild.

Warning: if you wish to make changes to the project settings, you need
to check out the .cwp (codewarrior project) file both in this directory
and in the resource.frk subdirectory; don't let them get out of sync!

Note: you can delete all the files in the resource.frk subdirectory 
except for the .cwp file.  If you delete that, Codewarrior's IDE will
crash on startup.

See also the README.TXT in ..\macbuild.
