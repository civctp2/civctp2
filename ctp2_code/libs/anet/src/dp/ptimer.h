/*------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Functions for timing function calls; uses the pentium clock to determine
  time. Records the average and maximum time for the function call and the
  number of times the function was called. As of now, only implemented on
  Win32 machines; defined as dummy macro on other platforms. Note that
  PTIMER_ENABLE must be defined below for timing stuff to work; it's disabled
  by default.

 To use this module, call ptimer_disableInterrupt() near the beginning
  of program to maximize process priority and ptimer_zeroAll() to initialize
  ptimer arrays. Pick an unique index from 0 to NPMAX-1 for your function
  call. Then call ptimer_Enter directly before the function call of interest
  and ptimer_Exit directly afterwards. The index argument for both calls
  is the index you picked and the subindex argument for ptimer_Exit allows
  you to differentiate within the same index. After you've finished timing
  everything, call ptimer_dumpToFile to write the time stats to file, by
  default "ptimer.log" and ptimer_enableInterrupt() to set normal priority
  for process.

 For sake of speed, no checking on indexes, etc is done in ptimer_Enter,
  ptimer_Exit. It is up to you to keep within array limits NPMAX, NPSUBMAX,
  to use unique indexes, and make calls in correct order (no recursion, etc).
  Note: on a P90, a ptimer_Enter, ptimer_Exit sequence takes about 5 ms.
