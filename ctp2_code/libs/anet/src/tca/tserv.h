/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Object that manages the account creation, login, and update process.

 All methods that take strings have two versions: a version ending in
 W that takes Unicode strings (wchar_t *'s), and a version ending in A
 that takes strings in the local 8 bit or multibyte character set (char *'s).

 All functions that return dp_result_t's in any way reserve the following two
 codes to always have the same meaning:
 dp_RES_BUG  - an internal failure has occurred.
 dp_RES_BAD  - the function was passed bad parameters.
 If either of these two codes are returned, the caller should probably abort
 the program, and the programmers responsible should fix the bug.
