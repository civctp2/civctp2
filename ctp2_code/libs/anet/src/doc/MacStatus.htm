<H1>Macintosh Library Status</H1>
<P>
2-6-97, L Bennett: I've managed to get the library, the internet
driver, the ipx driver, and gtest to compile under MetroWerks
CodeWarrior 2.1 and run. No communications occurs, however. I
can FTP on the machine, so it's not the wire. I also verified
with Mark Dinan that we have the complete code he delivered. The
build script runs correctly until the StuffIt Lite block.
