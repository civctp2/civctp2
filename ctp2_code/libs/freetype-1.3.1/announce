                   The FREE TrueType Font Engine


       Copyright (C) 1996-1999 The FreeType Development Team



  The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering
  engine, available in  ANSI C and Pascal source  code.  It has been
  developed  to  provide TrueType  support  to  a  great variety  of
  platforms and environments.
  
  Notice that  FreeType is a *library*.   It is *not*  a font server
  for your  preferred environment, even though it  has been designed
  to  be the  basis of  many  high-level libraries,  tools and  font
  servers.

  It's  a clean-room  implementation that  is not  derived  from the
  original TrueType engine developed  by Apple and Microsoft, though
  it matches it regarding rendering quality.  To our knowledge, it's
  the only royalty-free complete TrueType engine available.

  Version 1.3.1  fixes several bugs found  in 1.3.

  Version 1.3  fixes several bugs found  in 1.2, as  well as provide
  the engine  with enhanced capabilities, like  support for embedded
  bitmaps and rudimentary TrueType Open support.
