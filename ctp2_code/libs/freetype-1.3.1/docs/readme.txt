                code to tailor it to your own platform.

                Learn how to provide your own memory, i/o, and mutex
                components,  optimally fitted  to your  system.  See
                how you can build a singly-threaded, thread-safe, or
                re-entrant  version  of  the  engine from  the  same
                source code!

  ..................................................................

These  documents will probably  come later.

  develop.txt   The FreeType developer's guide. All you need to know
                in order to be able  to understand and even hack the
                engine's core source code.

  extend.txt    The FreeType extension writer's how-to. All you need
                to be able to provide new extensions to the engine.

  undoc.txt     Undocumented TrueType!

                Yes,    ladies   and    gentlemen,    the   TrueType
                specification  is  fuzzy  and misleading  enough  to
                disband some serious commercial developers, but that
                wasn't enough for us.  Even though it took some time
                (aaargh...), we finally discovered through hard work
                the real  meanings of  the specs, fixed  some errors
                and even found  surprising undocumented behaviour or
                features!
