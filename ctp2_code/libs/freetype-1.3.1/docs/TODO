FreeType TODO list

. Handle various PostScript glyph names in ftxpost.c:

            Omega vs. Ohm
            Delta vs. increment
            macron vs. overscore
            my vs. mu1
            periodcentered vs. middot

  with a new flag.


. Adaption of FreeType for non-ANSI compilers (wow, I'm heretic :-)


. More 16bit stuff to support _cdecl etc.  Maybe something like this
  may be used in place of the current EXPORT_DEF/EXPORT_FUNC:

           NEW_EXPORT_DEF( TT_Error )
           Cache_Create( PEngine_Instance  engine, ... )
