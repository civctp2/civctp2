. multiple configuration files similar to newer versions of gsftopk(k).

. support for different horizontal and vertical resolutions.

. character composition via the vpl file.

. using GSUB for accessing small caps (if available).

. enabling -v and -V at the same time.

. Omega support

. afm output

. possibility to create `real' fonts, i.e., avoiding virtual fonts for small
  caps etc. -- some dvi previewers still can't handle virtual fonts.  Due to
  the huge amount of work to support this it is rather unlikely that I'll do
  it.

. using hash tables to store glyph names for better performance

. show replacement glyphs too in glyph listings
