  This is a FreeType/2 programmers' mini-FAQ

Q1: Is the source code available?

A1: Yes! But if you think you have all you need, you're probably wrong :-)
   The source is now actually part of FreeType project, located at
      ftp://ftp.physiol.med.tu-muenchen.de/pub/freetype

   We have now the permission to distribute the OS/2 IFI headers with
   the FreeType/2 source code. They're all the files beginning with a
   "32" in the "ifi" directory. It seems that some people had problems
   with the download indicated in the last beta.


Q2: What compilers are supported?

A2: The development of FreeType/2 was done primarily in IBM's VisualAge C++
   version 3.0. It should be possible to build the DLL with Watcom C/C++ but
   it's not quite working yet.
    It is perhaps possible to build the Font Driver with another compiler,
   but you'll have to know the compiler (and OS/2 of course) _quite_ well.

    Note that the FreeType library itself supports also EMX/GCC (and I
    believe it was mainly developed in it).


Q3: What other tools do I need?

A3: You'll need a kernel debugger. Check out IBM's ICAT, it's great and
   it's free! Actually without ICAT this code would probably never happen.
    If you've lived under a rock and don't know what ICAT is, it's actually
   an interface to ol' good KDB. It is a source-level debugger and it looks
   and feels very much like the VisualAge debugger, IPMD.

    And if you haven't got it yet, you'll need _two_ computers to use ICAT.
   But believe me, it's worth it!
