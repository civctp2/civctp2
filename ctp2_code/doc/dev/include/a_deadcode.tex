\chapter{Code\label{cha:code}}
This chapter deals with code. Currently, just dead code is listed.
\begin{section}{Dead code list}

Within this list you see code and files which are \textbf{definitely} dead, i.e. not needed anymore. It's most likely that these files once may be scheduled for removal and even don't appear in this list.

\begin{verbatim}
ctp2_code/gfx/gfx.dsp
ctp2_code/gs/gs.dsp
ctp2_code/net/net.dsp
ctp2_code/ui/ui.dsp
\end{verbatim}

\end{section}% Dead code list

\begin{section}{Possibly dead code list}

This list contains code and files which maybe dead, but maybe aren't. Though these files appear to be unused this time, they may never be removed until they have been identified as dead code \textbf{without any doubts} and been in the dead code list for some while.

\begin{verbatim}
ctp2_code/robotcom/robotcom.dsp
ctp2_code/robotcom/robotcom.mak
ctp2_code/user-robotcom/robotcom.dsp
\end{verbatim}
