At the beginning of the 20th century, mankind had reached a technology level whereby oil refining, railroads, explosives, electricity and internal combustion were the standard discoveries known worldwide.  From this point in time a massive injection into science occured due to war, economics, imperialism and need.  The time 1900 - 1950 represents the end of the Imperialsm era and the transition into the Nuclear era.  By 1950 the United States of America with the United Kingdom were in the Cold War period with the communist power of USSR.

In 1899 Max Planck became a professor at the University of Berlin, after nine years at the University of Munich and Kiel University, in Germany. In his research there, he turned to a thermodynamic problem raised by one of his old teachers. The problem was that of a "black body," something that absorbs all frequencies (or wavelengths) of light. When heated it should then radiate all frequencies of light equally -- theoretically. But the distribution of energy radiated in "real life" never matched up with the predictions of classical physics. Several distinguished physicists had created complex equations trying to work it out, but none solved the problem. 

Planck was as steeped in traditional physics as his colleagues, but he had an open mind. The older way wasn't working. So he changed one basic assumption: energy, instead of being continuous, comes in distinct particles. These were later called "quanta," from the Latin for "how much?" Though it sounded outlandish, applying this idea to the problem of heated bodies revealed a simple relationship that explained previous puzzles. Planck found that the energy radiated from a heated body is exactly proportional to the wavelength of its radiation. So, a black body would not radiate all frequencies equally. As temperature goes up, energy increases and it's more likely that quanta with higher energy will be radiated. So, as an object heats up, the light given off is orange, then yellow, and eventually bluish. The wavelength emitted is a function of the energy times a constant (h), now known as Planck's constant. Though Planck's idea was not immediately believed by most physicists, it is now accepted as one of the fundamental constants in the universe. In fact, Planck himself wasn't sure if it was more than a little mathematics that resolved his own particular problem.

Late in the nineteenth century, Guglielmo Marconi began experimenting with electromagnetic waves to send signals. At that time, the telegraph wire was the quickest way to get messages from here to there, using Morse code. He designed a transmitter to send and a receiver to detect radio waves. By the end of the century Marconi had managed to send signals over several miles with no wires, and the idea was taking hold with naval officials. In 1898 he sent a wireless message 18 miles. In 1900 he patented his system.

On December 12, 1901, Marconi attempted to send the first radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean, in spite of predictions that the radio waves would be lost as the earth curved over that long distance. He set up a specially designed wireless receiver in Newfoundland, Canada, using a coherer (a glass tube filled with iron filings) to conduct radio waves, and balloons to lift the antenna as high as possible. The signals were sent in Morse code from Poldhu, Cornwall, in England. Marconi later wrote about the experience:

Shortly before midday I placed the single earphone to my ear and started listening. The receiver on the table before me was very crude -- a few coils and condensers and a coherer -- no valves, no amplifiers, not even a crystal. But I was at last on the point of putting the correctness of all my beliefs to test. The answer came at 12: 30 when I heard, faintly but distinctly, pip-pip-pip. I handed the phone to Kemp: "Can you hear anything?" I asked. "Yes," he said. "The letter S." He could hear it. I knew then that all my anticipations had been justified. The electric waves sent out into space from Poldhu had traversed the Atlantic -- the distance, enormous as it seemed then, of 1,700 miles -- unimpeded by the curvature of the earth. The result meant much more to me than the mere successful realization of an experiment.

French psychologist Alfred Binet (1859-1911) took a different tack than most psychologists of his day: he was interested in the workings of the normal mind rather than the pathology of mental illness. He wanted to find a way to measure the ability to think and reason, apart from education in any particular field. 

In 1905 he developed a test in which he had children do tasks such as follow commands, copy patterns, name objects, and put things in order or arrange them properly. He gave the test to Paris schoolchildren and created a standard based on his data. For example, if 70 percent of 8-year-olds could pass a particular test, then success on the test represented the 8-year-old level of intelligence. From Binet's work, the phrase "intelligence quotient," or "IQ," entered the vocabulary. The IQ is the ratio of "mental age" to chronological age, with 100 being average. So, an 8 year old who passes the 10 year-old's test would have an IQ of 10/8 x 100, or 125.

Binet's work set off a passion for testing and in the enthusiasm, a widespread application of tests and scoring measures developed from relatively limited data. Tests based on Binet's test were used by the U.S. Army in sorting out the vast numbers of recruits in World War I. The questions, however, had much more to do with general knowledge than with mental tasks such as sequencing or matching. The results, released after the war, showed that the majority of recruits had a juvenile intelligence. This shocking news played into the hands of eugenicists who argued that intelligence was an innate, inheritable trait limited to certain types (or nationalities) of people.

Orville and Wilbur Wright were inspired by Otto Lilienthal, a German glider pioneer. Though he crashed to his death in 1896, the Wrights were obsessed the technical problems involved in flight. They approached the issue methodically, working out ways to control a glider's tendency to pitch up and down, roll side to side, or yaw left and right. By the third glider they built, they had solved most of these problems of steering and stability.

To make a self-powered airplane, they needed to develop a very light gasoline engine and an appropriate propellor. By December 1903, their first airplane (Flyer I, later renamed Kitty Hawk) was ready to test. It had a 12.3 meter (40 1/2 feet) wingspan, was 6.4 meters (21 feet) long, and weighed about 274 kilos (605 pounds) without the pilot. It was powered by the Wrights' home-made 12 horsepower gasoline engine. The Wrights returned to the site at Kill Devil Hill near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, where they had tested their gliders. Their selection of this spot was based on national weather records which showed it to have consistently favorable conditions. 

The first day's attempt was unsuccessful, but in a few days, Orville flew the plane 37 meters (120 feet), which took 12 seconds. They made several more flights that day, the longest being 260 meters (852 feet) in 59 seconds. The Wrights' press release sent out the following month was largely ignored. Many people just didn't believe it, though there were five witnesses to their first flights. A report did appear in the March 1904 issue of Popular Science Monthly, but the first report of a firsthand sighting of the Wrights' plane was in the January 1905 issue of Gleanings in Bee Culture.

Einstein, a young cleark at the Swiss patent office, published several ideas that led to a total rethinking of physics. The publication that had the most profound effect was not the most ballyhooed at the time. Einstein received the Nobel Prize for one of the other ideas, but the special theory of relativity has since become the most well-known. When first published, the article didn't include the now-famous equation E=mc2, but later in 1905, he added it to another publication. The theory stated that the speed of light is constant and absolute -- it always goes the same speed, and nothing can go faster than that. In fact, as things travel at speeds approaching the speed of light, strange things happen to them. They get shorter in the direction of travel, their mass increases, and time passes more slowly for them. 

This was incredibly shocking to a world that saw Newton's laws of physics as sacrosanct. Everyone knew that space had three dimensions, and time only one. But Einstein put them together in one four-dimensional system where space and time cannot be separated or viewed independently. In that system, energy and mass are really the same. And that is the fundamental point of E=mc2: Energy equals matter times the speed of light squared. You only need a minute amount of matter, say, an atom, to create a tremendous amount of energy.

The implications of Einstein's theory were strange, but proved true mathematically and in the real world. Researchers calculated that going about a quarter of the speed of light would only change mass, length, and time measurements by 1 percent. That means that Newton's ideas and "laws" still work well for local measurements at ordinary speeds. This changes drastically the closer one goes to the speed of light: For an object moving at 6/7 the speed of light, its mass would be doubled.

In 1907, Henry Ford announced his goal for the Ford Motor Company: to create "a motor car for the great multitude." Ford's engineers took the first step towards this goal by designing the Model T, a simple, sturdy car, offering no factory options -- not even a choice of color. The Model T, first produced in 1908, kept the same design until the last one -- number 15,000,000 -- rolled off the line in 1927. From the start, the Model T was less expensive than most other cars, but it was still not attainable for the "multitude." Ford realized he'd need a more efficient way to produce the car in order to lower the price. He and his team looked at other industries and found four principles that would further their goal: interchangeable parts, continuous flow, division of labor, and reducing wasted effort.

Ford put these principles into play gradually over five years, fine-tuning and testing as he went along. In 1913, they came together in the first moving assembly line ever used for large-scale manufacturing. Ford produced cars at a record-breaking rate. That meant he could lower the price and still make a good profit by selling more cars. Ford had another notion, rather original in its time: the workers were also potential consumers! In 1914, Ford workers' wages were raised to $5 a day -- an excellent wage -- and they soon proved him right by buying their own Model Ts. Ford was called "a traitor to his class" by other industrialists and professionals, but he held firm in believing that well-paid workers would put up with dull work, be loyal, and buy his cars.

Ford's manufacturing principles were adopted by countless other industries. Henry Ford went beyond his 1907 goal of making cars affordable for all; he changed the habits of a nation, and shaped its very character.

After thinking about the problems for 10 years, Einstein published the general theory of relativity. In it, he suggested that gravity is not a force, as Newton had believed, but the result of a curvature of the space-time continuum -- the four dimensional world in which we live. He used a thought experiment to compare the force felt from gravity with acceleration. Imagine you are in an elevator and feel what you believe is the force of gravity, holding you to the floor. According to Einstein, since you cannot see outside the elevator, you cannot tell if you are feeling the force of gravity or if the elevator is being pushed toward your feet. Einstein stated that the two forces are actually identical. Furthermore, if you were in the elevator accelerating upward and a beam of light entered the elevator parallel to the floor, the light beam would appear to bend downward. This meant that light, which ordinarily traveled in straight lines, could curve if it traveled across a gravitational field. This curving path of light meant that that "field" was really a curving of space, which Einstein found was inseparable from time. The curvature would be caused by bodies with great mass.

Einstein postulated three ways this theory could be proved. One was by observing the stars during a total solar eclipse. The sun is our closest strong gravitational field. Light traveling from a star through space and passing the sun's field would be bent, if Einstein's theory were true. If you could see the star during the day, he predicted, it would be in a different place than at night. On March 29, 1919, that opportunity came. British Astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington traveled to Príncipe Island off the western coast of Africa. His team photographed starfields during the eclipse and compared the photos with those of the same starfield taken when the sun was not present. Eddington found the apparent location of the stars had shifted, just as Einstein predicted.

In 1911, Niels Bohr earned his PhD in Denmark with a dissertation on the electron theory of metals. Right afterwards, he went to England to study with J.J. Thomson, who had discovered the electron in 1897. Bohr soon went to visit Ernest Rutherford (a former student of Thomson's) in another part of England, where Rutherford had made a brand-new discovery about the atom.

In 1912 Bohr joined Rutherford. He realized that Rutherford's model wasn't quite right. By all rules of classical physics, it should be very unstable. For one thing, the orbiting electrons should give off energy and eventually spiral down into the nucleus, making the atom collapse. Or the electrons could be knocked out of position if a charged particle passed by. Bohr turned to Planck's quantum theory to explain the stability of most atoms. He found that the ratio of energy in electrons and the frequency of their orbits around the nucleus was equal to Planck's constant. Bohr suggested the revolutionary idea that electrons "jump" between energy levels (orbits) in a quantum fashion, that is, without ever existing in an in-between state. Thus when an atom absorbs or gives off energy (as in light or heat), the electron jumps to higher or lower orbits. Bohr published these ideas in 1913 to mixed reaction. Many people still hadn't accepted the idea of quanta, or they found other flaws in the theory because Bohr had based it on very simple atoms. But there was good evidence he was right: the electrons in his model lined up with the regular patterns (spectral series) of light emitted by real hydrogen atoms. 

Over the years other investigators refined Bohr's theory, but his bold application of new ideas paved the way for the development of quantum mechanics. Bohr went on to make enormous contributions to physics and, like Rutherford, to train a new generation of physicists. But his atomic model remains the best known work of a very long career.

A booming economy, after several years of "saving for the war effort," made the United States ripe for the explosion of consumer goods and technology that shaped the 1920s. The United States emerged from World War I a creditor nation and a dominant economic power. Business was booming. The idea of paying in installments may not have been new, but it became habit in the "jazz age." 

Electric appliances for the household were one of the biggest new market segments in the 1920s. Brooms and carpet beaters were replaced by the Electrolux, introduced in 1921. In 1923, Schick marketed an electric shaver. The spin dryer was introduced. The icebox gave way to the Frigidaire. Birdseye introduced frozen foods. Radios came with speakers instead of headsets (and there were regularly broadcast programs since KDKA began in 1920). While science entered more and more intimidating realms of abstraction, what with general relativity and the uncertainty principle, technology seemed more and more accessible as people mastered the use of machinery in their homes. 

But in this climate of high production and low cost, only the biggest corporations survived. From 1920 to 1928, more than 5,000 firms joined in corporate mergers. Among these were the local electric companies. Between 1919 and 1927, 3,700 local power companies went out of business; by 1930 10 holding companies supplied 72 percent of the nation's electricity.

The German Army first used chlorine gas cylinders in April 1915 against the French Army at Ypres. French soldiers reported seeing yellow-green clouds drifting slowly towards the Allied trenches. They also noticed its distinctive smell which was like a mixture of pineapple and pepper. At first the French officers assumed that the German infantry were advancing behind a smoke screen and orders were given to prepare for an armed attack. When the gas arrived at the Allied front-trenches soldiers began to complain about pains in the chests and a burning sensation in their throats. 

Most soldiers now realised they were being gassed and many ran as fast as they could away from the scene. An hour after the attack had started there was a four-mile gap in the Allied line. As the German soldiers were concerned about what the chlorine gas would do to them, they hesitated about moving forward in large numbers. This delayed attack enabled Canadian and British troops to retake the position before the Germans burst through the gap that the chlorine gas had created. 

Chlorine gas destroyed the respiratory organs of its victims and this led to a slow death by asphyxiation. One nurse described the death of one soldier who had been in the trenches during a chlorine gas attack. “He was sitting on the bed, fighting for breath, his lips plum coloured. He was a magnificent young Canadian past all hope in the asphyxia of chlorine. I shall never forget the look in his eyes as he turned to me and gasped: I can’t die! Is it possible that nothing can be done for me?” It was a horrible death, but as hard as they tried, doctors were unable to find a way of successfully treating chlorine gas poisoning.

On Christmas Eve, 1906, wireless operators on ships off the New England coast wondered if they'd had a religious experience. Out of the midst of Morse code dots and dashes beeping through their headsets came the sound of a voice reading the Christmas story from the Gospel of Luke and a violin playing "Silent Night." The voice wished them a merry Christmas, and then the dots and dashes started up again.

On November 2, 1920, station KDKA made the nation's first commercial broadcast (a term coined by Conrad himself). They chose that date because it was election day, and the power of radio was proven when people could hear the results of the Harding-Cox presidential race before they read about it in the newspaper.

The entry of mass communication into American homes meant, among other things, the development of a mass culture. The same songs were heard across the country, news travelled fast, and heroes like Charles Lindbergh or Joe Louis were, in a new way, accessible to all. Technological refinements in radio continued. Early in the 1920s, headsets were replaced with speakers. In 1929, FM radio became available. The development of the transistor in the late 1940s paved the way for the transistor radio's appearance in 1952. Stereophonic sound and personal stereos would continue radio's evolution.

In 1923 Vladimir Zworykin (1889-1982) also applied for a patent. His was for a television camera that converted optical images into electrical pulses. About six years later he had developed a receiver and in 1930 demonstrated his system at RCA. 

Meanwhile, in Japan, Kenjiro Takayanagi was developing electronic television, too. He was ahead of Zworykin, but better publicity gave Zworykin the nickname "father of television." Takayanagi transmitted an image electronically in 1926, with a 40-line resolution and film running at 14 frames per second.

In 1932 the BBC ventured the first regularly broadcast programs using Baird's mechanical equipment, though it had been broadcasting special events and other sporadic transmissions since 1927. The first special-purpose television station was built in Germany in 1935 in preparation for the Berlin Olympic Games the following year. That Olympic year, NBC experimented with electronic broadcast from the top of the Empire State Building. The first live journalistic event covered by television was the 1937 coronation of Britain's King George VI. That year, the BBC began the first regular, high-quality broadcasting service using an electronic system.

Eugenics is the idea of specialised human behaviour, or genetics.  Eugenics was popular during the start of the 20th century due to the strong feelings of nationalism still prevalent from the 19th century.  Though as history was to show, social groups do not always do "good".

By 1900 the word 'Eugenics' was widely used by scientists who had rediscovered the work of Gregor Mendel. Mendel had meticulously recorded the results of cross-breeding pea plants, and found a very regular statistical pattern for features like height and color. This introduced the concept of genes, opening the field of genetics to a tumultuous century of research. One path of genetic research branched off into the shadows of social theory, and in the first quarter of the twentieth century became immensely popular as eugenics. It was presented as a mathematical science that could be used to predict the traits and behaviors of humans, and in a perfect world, to control human breeding so that people with the best genes would reproduce and thus improve the species.

In 1923, organizers founded the American Eugenics Society, and it quickly grew to 29 chapters around the country. At fairs and exhibitions, eugenicists spread the word and hosted "fitter family" and "better baby" competitions to award blue ribbons to the finest human stock -- not unlike the awards for prize bull and biggest pumpkin. Not only did eugenicists promote better breeding, they wanted to prevent poor breeding or the risk of it. That meant keeping people with undesireable traits in their heritage (including alcoholism, pauperism, or epilepsy) separate from others or, where law allowed, preventing them from reproducing. 

As the weight of the scientific community shifted toward behaviorism and true genetics, popular opinion followed. John Watson's articles about childrearing and self-improvement popularized behaviorism still further. The eugenics craze was already fading when the horrors of institutionalized eugenics revealed in Nazi Germany during World War II doused it entirely as a movement.

The first wireless transmission was made in 1892 by William Preece. Marconi, disappointed by a lack of support from the Italian government, decided to move to London. During his early work he also found out that the radio waves could be reflected into narrow beams by using sheets of metal sheets around the antenna. Marconi had an Irish cousin who helped him take out his first patent. As a result of the interest of the British Post Office he improved the system and was able to send a signal nine miles across the Bristol Channel. Marconi was now making great progress with his work and was able to communicate with a French wireless station that was some 31 miles across the English Channel.

Marconi decided to replace the wire receiver with a glass tube filled with iron filings. This was an improvement and on the 11th of December 1901 Marconi transmitted a signal from Poldhu on Cornwall to St John's in Newfoundland, 2,000 miles away.

By 1914 wireless telegraphy had developed sufficiently to play an important role in warfare. Wireless was widely employed by wartime ground forces. Large naval vessels were fitted with radios, although when they were used, it did make it easier for enemy submarines to discover where they were. Reconnaissance aircraft that had enough power to carry wireless sets (they weighed 50kg) were able to communicate the position of enemy artillery.

Georges LeMaitre (1894-1966) showed that religion and science -- or at least physics -- did not have to be incompatible. LeMaitre, born in Belgium, was a monsignor in the Catholic church. In 1927, the year he got his PhD from MIT, LeMaitre proposed this theory, in which he stated that the expanding universe was the same in all directions -- the same laws applied, and its composition was the same -- but it was not static.

In 1929 at the Mt. Wilson Observatory in California, Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies were moving away at high speeds. He was, like most people, unaware of LeMaitre's 1927 theory. But LeMaitre used Hubble's dramatic discovery as evidence for his theory. It was easy. If you imagined the galaxies rushing away from us as a movie, just run the movie backwards. After a certain time, all those galaxies will rush together. LeMaitre put forth the idea that there was once a primordial atom which had contained all the matter in the universe. 

The other support LeMaitre used was the idea of entropy, which states that everything is moving towards greater and greater disorder. 

Others took notice and named his theory "big bang." LeMaitre's ideas opened more questions, many of which forced physics and astronomy together: What was that primordial atom like? Why would it explode? He pursued the topic for some time, even suggesting that there ought to be some form of background radiation in the universe, left over from the initial explosion of that primordial atom. He became more interested in the philosophical ramifications of his theory, which were many.

In 1927, Werner Heisenberg was in Denmark working at Niels Bohr's research institute in Copenhagen. The two scientists worked closely on theoretical investigations into quantum theory and the nature of physics. Bohr was away on a skiing holiday, and Heisenberg was left to mull things over himself. He had a shocking but clear realization about the limits of physical knowledge: the act of observing alters the reality being observed. At least at the subatomic level. To measure the properties of a particle such as an electron, one needs to use a measuring device, usually light or radiation. But the energy in this radiation affects the particle being observed. If you adjust the light beam to accurately measure position, you need a short-wavelength, high-energy beam. It would tell you position, but its energy would throw off the momentum of the particle. Then, if you adjust the beam to a longer wavelength and lower energy, you could more closely measure momentum, but position would be inaccurate. 

The uncertainty principle was hard even for scientists to accept at first. After struggling with it, however, Bohr developed complementarity theory. This stated that there was a dual nature to things -- an electron was a wave and a particle, for example -- but we could only perceive one side of that dual nature. A sphere, for instance, has a convex and concave aspect. We can sense the convex from outside the sphere, but from inside it appears completely concave. This theory would affect much more than physics, but other fields of science, as well as art and philosophy.

Heisenberg and Bohr's theories were compatible and became known together as the Copenhagen interpretation and accepted as the foundation for quantum theory.

Alexander Fleming returned to his research laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital in London after World War I. His battlefront experience had shown him how serious a killer bacteria could be, much worse even than enemy artillery. He wanted to find a chemical that could stop bacterial infection. 

Fleming had so much going on in his lab that it was often in a jumble. This disorder proved very fortunate. In 1928, he was straightening up a pile of Petri dishes where he had been growing bacteria, but which had been piled in the sink. He opened each one and examined it before tossing it into the cleaning solution. One made him stop and say, "That's funny." 

Some mold was growing on one of the dishes... not too unusual, but all around the mold, the staph bacteria had been killed... very unusual. He took a sample of the mold. He found that it was from the penicillium family, later specified as Penicillium notatum. Fleming presented his findings in 1929, but they raised little interest. He published a report on penicillin and its potential uses in the British Journal of Experimental Pathology. 

The biggest problem was producing enough penicillin. This was hard and expensive to accomplish. Florey and another researcher traveled to the U.S. to talk to chemical manufacturers and ended up in Peoria, Illinois. The agriculture of Illinois proved useful. The nutrient base for the penicillin grown there was corn (maize), which was not commonly grown in Britain. The penicillin loved it, and yielded almost 500 times as much as it had before. More vigorous and productive strains of the mold were sought, and one of the best came from a rotting canteloupe from a Peoria market!

In 1935 Robert Watson-Watt wrote a paper entitled The Detection of Aircraft by Radio Methods. This was presented to Henry Tizard, the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence. Watson-Watt's was based on the idea of bouncing a radio wave against an object and measuring its travel to provide targeting information. It was called radar (radio detection and ranging). 

By the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Watson-Watt had designed and installed a chain of radar stations along the East and South coast of England. During the Battle of Britain these stations were able to detect enemy aircraft at any time of day and in any weather conditions.

Radar was also used by ships and aircraft during the war. Germany was using radar by 1940 but Japan never used it effectively. The United States had a good radar system and it was able to predict the attack on Pearl Harbor an hour before it happened. Britain tended to have the best radar system during the early stages of the war and in 1940 the invention of the Magnetron cavity resonator enabled more centimetric waves to be transmitted. It also enabled more compact high-frequency sets to be used by aircraft in the Royal Air Force.

In 1941 the Royal Navy began employing the ASV-3 radar system that helped them locate and attack U-Boats. In December 1942, the RAF began using the Oboe navigational system. A control station in Britain broadcast a radar beam in the direction of the target, and another beam tracked an Oboe-equipped Pathfinder bomber. A person in the control station could then guide the aircraft directly to the target.

When Ernest Orlando Lawrence (1901-1958) got his PhD in physics, the hottest topic was bombarding the atom's nucleus to see what new particles it might produce. Ernest Rutherford had only recently shown that striking the atom of one element could make it emit electrons and turn into a different element.

The University of California gave Lawrence the go-ahead to build what he called the cyclotron in 1930. With some graduate students, he tried a number of different set-ups. They had success using electrodes, a radio frequency oscillator producing 10 watts, a vacuum, hydrogen ions, and a 10 cm electromagnet. The whole contraption was quite small. With a larger magnet, Lawrence's team was able to produce 80,000 electron volts in 1931, and later the same year, with a 25 cm cyclotron, 1 million electron volts. In 1939, a 152 cm device was being used for medical purposes, and Lawrence won the Nobel Prize in physics. Work was begun on a 467 cm machine in 1940, but World War II interrupted its development. Lawrence's team turned its attention to producing the uranium-235 needed for the atomic bomb.

The development of the cyclotron and the growth of Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory had tremendous implications for science and the way it's done. This new tool could probe the atom's nucleus and offered applications in medicine and chemical research. It launched the modern era of high-energy physics. But it also launched the era of "big science"-- a new way of organizing scientific work. To feed and care for these increasingly large, complex, and expensive tools required more staff and above all, more money. Governments and corporations saw they had a stake in such research and stepped in as funders.

A bank of blinking lights indicate the mysterious processes going on within: That classic symbol of a computer has lasted long after computers evolved into friendly desktop tools. This was not a dream of science fiction, but a representation of ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator Analyzer and Computer), the gigantic machine credited with starting the modern computer age. ENIAC, with its 17,468 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 1,500 relays, and 6,000 manual switches, was a monument of engineering -- and an energy hog. The city of Philadelphia reportedly experienced brown-outs when ENIAC drew power at its home at the Moore School of Electrical Engingeering at the University of Pennsylvania. 

ENIAC was a product of World War II. The military needed to develop firing tables for its artillery, so that gunners in the field could quickly look up which settings to use with a particular weapon on a particular target under particular conditions. The Ballistics Research Laboratory heard about the work of John Mauchly at the Moore School. In 1942, he had suggested using vacuum tubes to speed computer calculations. 

It took about a year to design ENIAC, and 18 months to build it. By the time it was completed, in November 1945, the war had been over for three months. The project was 200 percent over budget (total cost approximately $500,000). But it had achieved what it set out to do. A calulation like finding the cube root of 2589 to the 16th power could be done in a fraction of a second. In a whole second ENIAC could execute 5,000 additions, 357 multiplications, and 38 divisions. This was up to a thousand times faster than its predecessors. A little too late for World War II, ENIAC was kept busy through the Cold War, working on such projects as calculations for the design of a hydrogen bomb.

On the advice of General Jan Smuts, it was decided in April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force (RAF) by amalgamating the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) with the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). A fleet of light and medium monoplane bombers were developed before 1937, notably the Vickers Wellington. The RAF also obtained two fast, heavily armed interceptor aircraft, the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire, for defence against enemy bombers.

Immediately after the defeat of France, Adolf Hitler ordered his generals to organize the invasion of Britain. The invasion plan was given the code name Sealion. The objective was to land 160,000 German soldiers along a forty-mile coastal stretch of south-east England. Within a few weeks the Germans had assembled a large armada of vessels, including 2,000 barges in German, Belgian and French harbours. However, Hitler's generals were very worried about the damage that the Royal Air Force could inflict on the German Army during the invasion. Hitler therefore agreed to their request that the invasion should be postponed until the British airforce had been destroyed.

During the war the RAF used 333 flying training schools. In all, between 1940 and 1945 the scheme trained out aircrew from Britain (88,022), Canada (137,739), Australia (27,387), South Africa (24,814), Southern Rhodesia (10,033) and New Zealand (5,609).

The German military strategy of using fast-moving tanks, with motorized infantry and artillery supported by dive-bombers, and concentrating on one part of the enemy sector, became known as Blitzkreig (lightning war). The strategy was first put forward by Colonel John Fuller, the chief of staff of the British Tank Corps. Fuller's ideas were ignored by the British Army but was studied in Germany and in 1926 leaders of the the German Army asked the government to commission the production of new tanks that would enable them to use Blitzkreig tactics in any future conflicts. 

After Adolf Hitler obtained power in 1933, the German government was open about its tank production. In the spring of 1934 the German Army began developing the Panzer tank. Over the next few years the Panzer I, Panzer II, Panzer III and Panzer IV were produced. 

During the invasion of Poland in September, 1939, it became clear that the Panzer I was insufficiently armed for battle conditions. Panzer II and Panzer III tanks were reliable but were outgunned. The outstanding performer was the Panzer IV as it had the perfect combination of speed, agility, firepower and reliability. Over the next few years it became the backbone of Blitzkrieg and over 9,000 of these tanks were produced. 

However, the the successful resistance of the Red Army in the Soviet Union in 1942 showed that the Panzer IV was no longer invincible. This resulted in the production of the Panther and it eventually became the most popular tank used in Germany. The greatest exponents of Blitzkrieg were the German commanders, Heinz Guderian and Erwin Rommel.

When it became clear that Adolf Hitler was rapidly increasing the size Germany's armed forces, new ships were ordered in 1937 but none were ready when the Second World War started in 1939. Even so, the British naval forces were the largest in the world in 1939. By the outbreak of war the Royal Navy had 15 large battleships, 15 heavy cruisers, 46 light cruisers, 7 aircraft carriers, 181 destroyers and 59 submarines. However, only about half had been modernized and the rest were deficient in horizontal armour needed for protection against modern, long-range shellfire.

The French Navy had been responsible for containing the Italian Navy but after Henri-Philippe Petain signed the armistice with Nazi Germany in June, 1940, the British had to divert ships to the Mediterranean. 

The German U-Boats now also had bases on the Atlantic coast which put them much closer to British trade routes. The Royal Navy used its older ships to protect the convoys bringing goods from the United States. From 1941 it was also able to use its growing number of corvettes. 

The turning point in the naval war came when the Bismarck was sunk after being surrounded and fired on by King George V, Rodney, the Norfork and the Dorsetshire on 26th May, 1941. The loss of its largest ship marked the end of the German Navy's incursions into the Atlantic.

Enrico Fermi (1901-1954) left Italy in 1938 to receive the Nobel Prize for physics in Sweden. He never went back. He and his wife moved to the United States to escape Italy's increasing fascism and antisemitism. 

Fermi's task was to create a controlled nuclear reaction; that is, to split the atom without creating a deadly explosion. Theoretically, it was possible. During fission, a fast-moving neutron splits an atom's nucleus, which results in the release of energy and additional neutrons. These ejected neutrons can split other nuclei, which release other neutrons to split still other nuclei, and so on: a self-sustaining chain reaction. If this chain reaction went too fast, it became an atomic explosion, but under control it could produce a steady flow of energy.

At the University of Chicago, Fermi worked with a team to find a way to control the chain reaction. He did this by setting up the equipment -- atomic pile -- so that he could insert a neutron-absorbing material into the midst of the fission process to slow it down or stop it altogether. He found that rods made of cadmium would absorb neutrons. If the chain reaction speeded up, the cadmium rods could be inserted to slow it down and could be removed to accelerate it again. By the end of 1942, the team was ready for its first test. The equipment was set up in a squash court at the University of Chicago. The moment was tense: if their theories and experiments until now proved wrong, they could blow up half of Chicago. A few of the rods were pulled out, and the reaction began. The team could increase or decrease the energy output by adjusting the rods. Fermi's idea had worked, and the first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved.

Transistors were a giant leap from vacuum tubes.  Many big, clunky, breakable vacuum tubes were required for even the simplest calculations in early computers.  However, the transistor is small, fast and hardy.  The transistor has enabled modern computers to have thousands of transistors on a chip the size of a small fingernail.

By 1906, because of the work of Lee de Forest, inventors knew the two basic functions of a vacuum tube -- converting alternating current to direct current and amplifying an electronic signal. Over the decades, vacuum tubes were improved and were used in more and more complicated circuitry. At the 1939 World's Fair, for example, vacuum tubes were showcased in fully electronic television. And by 1945, the high-speed computer ENIAC was built, containing more than 17,000 tubes. Vacuum tubes were bulky, used a lot of energy, and were somewhat fragile and easy to overheat. Engineers knew they needed to find something different. 

The idea of somehow using semiconductors (solid materials such as silicon that conduct electricity, but not as well as a conductor such as copper) had been tossed about before World War II, but knowledge about how they worked was scant, and manufacturing semiconductors was difficult. In 1945, however, the vice president for research at Bell Labs established a research group to look into it. The group was led by William Shockley and included Walter Brattain, John Bardeen, and others, physicists who had worked with quantum theory, especially in solids. 

The transistor was a solid (thus the term "solid-state technology") but had the electrical properties of a vacuum tube. Yet it had none of the drawbacks: it was cheap, sturdy, used little power, worked instantly, and best of all, was tiny. Bell began to license the use of transistors (for a royalty) and offered courses on transistor technology, helping spread the word throughout the industry. The first transistor available to consumers was in hearing aids, followed quickly by transistor radios. The computer industry immediately began designing computers using transistors that were faster, smaller, more economical, and more powerful.

Wallace Carothers was 32 years old when he was appointed director of Du Pont Corporation's research center. He had studied and taught organic chemistry before that, with a specialization in polymers, molecules composed of long chains of repeating units of atoms. Polymers were little-understood molecules when Carothers began his work. He made major contributions to the understanding of their structure and of polymerization, how these long chain molecules form.

Du Pont's goal was basic research with possible industrial applications, especially in the field of artificial materials. The search was on for a synthetic fiber. By 1934, Carothers had a promising development: He combined the chemicals amine, hexamethylene diamine, and adipic acid. It created fibers! But they were weak. They had formed by the polymerizing process known as a condensation reaction, in which individual molecules join together, with water as a byproduct. Carothers' breakthrough came when he realized the water produced by the reaction was dropping back into the mixture and getting in the way of more polymers forming. He adjusted his equipment so that the water was distilled and removed from the system. It worked!

Carothers drew out fibers that were long, strong, and very elastic. Du Pont named this product nylon. The chemists called it Nylon 66 because the adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine each contain 6 carbon atoms per molecule.

It was exactly what Du Pont had hoped for, and nylon was patented in 1935. It hit the markets in 1939 and was an instant hit, especially as a replacement for silk in hosiery. Carothers did not see the widespread application of his work -- in consumer goods such as toothbrushes, fishing lines, and lingerie, or in special uses such as surgical thread, parachutes, or pipes.

In June, 1942, Germany began working on a new secret weapon. It was officially known as the F2G-76 but was also called Vergeltung (Retribution) as it was built in response to the mass bombing of urban areas in Germany. British intelligence first became aware of this new weapon when on 22nd August, 1942, a Danish naval officer discovered an early test version that had crash landed on a small island between Germany and Sweden. The officer sent a photograph and a detailed sketch of the bomb to Britain and preparations began to deal with this new weapon that had the potential to win the war for Germany.

Military intelligence eventually discovered that the V-1 missile was being built at Peenemünde and in May, 1943, Winston Churchill ordered Operation Crossbow, a plan to destroy V-1 production and launch sites. Over the next few months over 36,000 tons of bombs were dropped on these targets. 

The V-1 (also known as a flying bomb, buzz bomb or doodlebug) was a pilotless monoplane that was powered by a pulse-jet motor and carried a one ton warhead. They were launched from a fixed ramp and travelled at about 350mph and 4,000ft and had a range of 150 miles (240km). It was 8 metres (25 feet) long and had a wingspan of about 5.5 metres (20 feet).

Germany fired 9,521 V-I bombs on southern England. Of these 4,621 were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire or by RAF fighters such as the new turbojet fighter, the Gloster Meteor. An estimated 6,184 people were killed by these flying bombs. By August only 20 per cent of these bombs were reaching England.

As gunpowder revolutionized the world of infantry and melee combat in the 16th century, it revolutionized siege weapons in the mid 1300s.  Although the earliest "bombards" were unwieldy, unreliable and relatively weak siege weapons, improvements in metallurgy in the next two centuries dramatically increased the quality of smelted iron and bronze.  By the beginning of the 16th century, iron cannon, cast in blast furnaces, began to improve.  Cannons accompanied by infantry and cavalry replaced catapults, pikemen and knights on the battlefields of Europe and Asia.  Ships also capitalized on the emerging cannon technology to intensify naval combat.

The Australian Cavalry were transferred to Palestine and served under General Sir Edmund Allenby. The Australians fought with distinction and played an important role in the highly successful Battle of Gaza. After occupying El Arish in Sinai in December 1916, the ANZAC mounted division led British forces up to the Palestine border. With his forces needed elsewhere, General Archibald Murray, Commander in Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, postponed making further advances. 

General Friedrich Kressenstein, commander of the Turkish Expeditionary Force, occupied the coastal fortress of Gaza, blocking the main route into Palestine. General Murray was determined to take Gaza and sent General Dobell, commander of the Eastern Forces, in March 1917. Kressenstein had 18,000 men but was outnumbered 2 to 1 by Dobell's forces. 

General Dobell massed the main bulk of his men 8km from Gaza. Undetected in a dense sea fog, Dobell's cavalry was able to cut off the town's rear on the 26th March. The main infantry attack that followed was less successful. A Turkish counterattack and water shortages forced Dobell to order his men to retreat. General Dobell lost 4,000 men against about 2,400 Turkish and German casualties. Dobell estimated that the Turks lost three times that number and at the time the battle was reported as a British victory. 

Victory at Gaza had unlocked the defences of the Turks. In the weeks that followed, the Turks retreated 75 miles and on 9th December the allied forces took Jerusalem. Although a clear victory, between October and December, 1917, the British and Empire forces lost 19,702 men during the campaign in the Middle East.

Among the ruins of eastern Mediterranean civilizations lay the roots of diplomacy.  Records detailing treaties between Mesopotamian city-states date from 2850 BC.  The first diplomatic language was Akkadian (Babylonian), serving as an international tongue until Aramaic replaced it.  Archaeologists discovered cuneiform tablets from the 14th century BC documenting a diplomatic correspondence, in Akkadian, between the Egyptian court and a Hittite king.  The full texts of treaties between Ramses II of Egypt and Hittite leaders existed as well.  China had leagues, missions and a system of diplomatic correspondence as early as the 8th century BC, and evidence of sophisticated Indian diplomacy in the 4th century BC implies it developed even earlier.  The Greek system of diplomacy, however, became the model for international diplomacy in much of the West for centuries.

Greek heralds were the first diplomats, protected by the gods with immunity from harm.  Hermes, messenger of the gods and patron god of heralds, was associated with the institution of diplomacy.  Although, as the herald of Zeus, he gained a reputation for being persuasive and eloquent, he was also known as a dishonest knave, a stigma that became associated with diplomats well into modern times.  Heralds were recognized internationally as unassailable, meaning that, even in foreign lands, they were almost never assaulted, imprisoned or otherwise harmed.  To signify their inviolable status, heralds and messengers often carried an emblem, such as a message stick, and were received by their hosts with great ceremony.  Because of this, heralds were often used as contacts between nations at war.  They often preceded small groups of envoys to arrange safe passage.  Envoys, traveling in groups to ensure loyalty, were politically prominent orators dispatched to sway foreign assemblies and leaders.

The earliest firearms were primitive devices, lacking buttstock or trigger, which had to be held under the arm making them difficult to aim.  The harquebus, which employed both of these things, was developed in the late 15th century.  It's slow rate of fire and inaccuracy did not make up for the fact that soldiers could now fire from their shoulders.  Nevertheless, some 16th century armies, most notably the Spanish tercio, employed harquebusiers with pikemen, who would open fire on approaching enemies and then retreat behind the pikemen as the range of combat got closer.  In 1588, 10,000 English troops were experimentally equipped with firearms, against Spanish forces relying on archers; the success of the English forces played a major role in the rise of firearms as the weapon of choice for infantrymen.  

The musket was the first firearm to employ a flintlock firing mechanism.  Heavier and more powerful than a harquebus, it could be relied on to fire 2 to 3 times a minute at 100 to 150 yard range with minimal misfires.  By the end of the Thirty Years' War, infantrymen, armed with muskets, and pikemen were about equal in numbers for most armies.  Smaller tactical groups of infantrymen facilitated quicker rate of group fire with minimal mutual interference.  Lines dropped from 8 to 10 in the 17th century to 2 to 3 at the end of the 18th century.  Military strategists, most notably Prince Maurice of Nassau, a great Dutch military teacher, developed drill - the preparation for war by prescribed movements and formations - to increase efficiency.  The invention of the bayonet in 1670 gave infantries little reason to keep pikemen, and infantry units employed muskets and bayonet exclusively from then on.

In 1884 Hiram Maxim invented the world's first automatic portable machine-gun. Maxim used the energy of each bullet's recoil force to eject the spent cartridge, insert the next and fire it. The machine-gun would therefore fire until the entire belt of bullets was used up. 

The Maxim Gun was adopted by the British Army in 1889. It was first used by Britain`s colonial forces in the Matabele war in 1893-94. In one engagement, fifty police of the Rhodesian character company fought off 5,000 Matabele warriors with just four Maxim guns. The design was taken over by the Vickers Company and was used by the army for over seventy years.

The Maxim Gun could fire 400-600 rounds of small-calibre ammunition per minute. Each gun had the firepower of about 100 rifles. The German Army's Maschinengewehr and the Russian Pulemyot Maxima were both based on the same design. The American Army tended to use the Browning Machine-Gun whereas the French Army preferred the Hotchkiss. 

Machine-guns were positioned all along the Western Front. The machine-guns in use in 1914 required a crew of three to six men and were positioned on a flat trajectory tripod. For added protection, German machine-guns were often housed inside concrete blockhouses. 

Both sides also used smaller machine-gun posts. Germans built them in large numbers all along the line at Ypres and Messines. Machine-gunners were deeply hated by the infantry and they were more likely to be killed when captured than other soldiers.

Throughout history, leaders of nations have always required vast amounts of information in order to implement foreign policy, military strategy, diplomatic negotiation and participation in international organizations.  To sate this thirst, and to protect their safety and interests, governments have always maintained some kind of intelligence capability.  Not surprisingly, all nations have laws against espionage, but most have vast networks of spies operating in other lands.

The Chinese military theorist Sun Tzu espoused the importance of intelligence in his book The Art of War (circa 500 BC).  In it, he gave detailed instructions for espionage systems, including double agents and defectors.  Until the rise of nationalism in the 18th century, and the growth of standing armies and diplomatic establishments, intelligence-gathering operations were indiscriminately designed by rules and military leaders.  

Joseph Fouché, duc d'Otrante, minister of police during the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, established one of the first political espionage systems.  Fouché retained a network of police agents and professional spies to root out conspiracies by the Jacobins and Bourbon Royalists to seize power.  In the early 19th century, the Austrian statesman Prince von Metternich also employed an organization of political and military spies.  The most notorious intelligence organizations of the 19th century was the dreaded Okhrana (Department for Defense of Public Security and Order) of the Russian tsars, created in 1825 to search for internal opposition to the current regime.

20th century urban planning saw the rise of the concept of zoning -- setting limits for building height, neighborhood density and construction activity.  Most cities had grown organically, and as the Industrial Revolution shifted the role and dominance of cities to the fore, they became sprawling, disorganized eyesores, with commercial, industrial and residential areas intertwined and seemingly built on top of each other.

Public transportation was the answer to many issues -- overcrowding, complex street systems, traffic, congested commercial districts, and shortages of housing -- that plagued the sprawling metropolis.  Urban planning was also important to the revitalization of Europe after World War II, where planners shifted their focus to the reconstruction of areas destroyed by war.

By the middle of the 20th century, urban planners experimented with new concepts for towns and cities, and endeavored to create the ideal urban area.  "Planned communities" sprang up, with transportation, recreation, industrial and residential systems in place.  Rather than focusing on fixing problems, planners sought to develop urban areas that would evolve with the changing needs of their citizenry.  Though there have been spectacular failures, many planned cities are a testament to the wisdom of long-term, scalable urban plans that focus on the total living experience.

The French Army Air Service (Aéronautique Militaire) was formed in October 1910. France led the world in early aircraft design and by mid-1912 they had five squadrons (escadrilles). This had grown to 132 machines (21 escadrilles) by 1914. 

At the beginning of the First World War the Aéronautique Militaire concentrated on reconnaissance work with aircraft like the Farman MF-II. This changed after Roland Garros, added deflector plates to the blades of the propeller of his Morane-Saulnier. Garros, in some respects, the world's first fighter pilot, was shot down and captured, but his example inspired a change in tactics.

The Nieuport II, Nieuport 17 , and Spad S-XIII were popular aircraft with French pilots during the war. So also was the Voisin V light bomber that became available in 1915. France's most successful fighter pilots included Rene Fonck (75), Georges Guynemer (53) and Charles Nungesser (43). 

By April 1917, the Aéronautique Militaire had 2,870 aircraft comprising 60 fighter and 20 bomber squadrons and 400 observation planes. By the Armistice this had increased to 3,222 aircraft, with 127,630 officers and men.

Richard Edgeworth invented the Caterpillar track in 1770. In the Crimean War a small number of steam powered tractors based on this design proved very successful in the muddy terrain. The development of the modern tank remained dormant until the arrival of the internal combustion engine, patented by Gottlieb Daimler in 1885. 

In 1899 Frederick Simms produced a design of what he called a motor-war car. This vehicle had a Daimler engine, a bulletproof shell and was armed with 2 maxim guns on revolving turrets. The British War Office rejected Simms' car and showed no interest in similar schemes.

By the outbreak of the First World War Richard Hornsby & Sons produced the Killen-Strait Armoured Tractor. The tracks consisted of a continuous series of steel links, joined together with steel pins. In June 1915 the Killen-Strait was tested out in front of Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George at Wormwood Scrubs. The machine successfully cut through barbed wire entanglements. The Landships Committee and the newly-formed Inventions Committee, agreed with Swinton's proposal and commissioned Lieutenant W. G. Wilson of the Naval Air Service and William Tritton of William Foster & Co. Ltd. of Lincoln, to produce a small landship. Constructed in great secrecy, the machine was given the code-name tank by Swinton.

Nicknamed Little Willie, this prototype tank with its Daimler engine, had track frames 12 feet long, weighed 14 tons and could carry a crew of three, at speeds of just over three miles. The speed dropped to less than 2 mph over rough ground and most importantly of all, was unable to cross broad trenches. Although the performance was disappointing, Ernest Swinton remained convinced that when modified, the tank would enable the Allies to defeat the Central Powers.

The word artillery was used to describe large-calibre mounted firearms. The calibre is the diameter of its barrel bore. In the 19th century artillery was divided into light and heavy, depending on the weight of solid shot fired. Light guns, deployed at battalion level, were usually 4-6 pounders, whereas heavy guns were 8-12 pounders. 

At the beginning of the First World War the main support weapon for the British Army was the long-barrelled field gun. Also available was the QF (quick-firing) field gun that had a recoil system that bounced the barrel back into firing position. 

Howitzers were developed to be used under cover or against hidden targets. These fired heavy shells on a high trajectory through a short barrel and were the best type of artillery gun to employ against fortifications. 
Another high-trajectory gun was the mortar. The projectile was dropped into its broad, stubby barrel and was fired by a pre-loaded explosive charge. By the end of the war some of these guns were capable of firing shells up to about 2km. 

The stalemate caused by the trench system resulted in military commanders demanding long-range heavy field guns. Heavy howitzers (200-400mm) could fire shells weighing over 900kg over 18km. The British Army also asked for heavy guns that were light enough to be pulled across mud and shell-shattered ground.

Nearly all infantryman in the First World War used bolt action rifles. This type of rifle had been invented by a Scottish immigrant to the United States, James Paris Lee. The bolt is the device that closes the breech of the barrel. The bolt-action rifle had a metal box, into which cartridges were placed on top of a spring. As the bolt was opened, the spring forced the cartridges up against a stop; the bolt pushed the top cartridge into the chamber as it closed. After firing, the opening of the bolt extracted the empty cartridge case, and the return stroke loaded a fresh round. 

Cartridges were injected into the magazine by means of a clip. They consisted of open-ended slides or cases within which a number of cartridges, 3, 5 or 6 were gripped by the spring metal of the case or a spring incorporated in the base. 

The popular bolt action rifle of Russia was the Moisin-Nagant (Russia).

The American inventor, David Bushnell, began experimenting with the idea of producing a ship that could travel underwater in the latter years of the eighteenth-century. Attempts were also made to produce submarines during the American Civil War. 

The first Royal Navy submarine was developed by John P. Holland and was launched in 1902. At this time France led the world in the design and construction of steam-powered underwater boats. However, after 1905, Germany began to develop a submarine with real fighting qualities. In 1913 Germany produced its first diesel-powered Unterseeboot (U-boat). 

By the outbreak of the First World War Germany had 10 diesel-powered U-boats (17 more under construction). The German Navy also had 30 petrol-powered submarines. Britain had 55 submarines whereas the French had 77. Although submarines were slow, fragile and able to dive for only a couple of hours at a time, with torpedoes they posed a serious threat to other ships. 

Submarines during the war had four torpedo tubes in the bow and one or two in the stern, with 16 cm guns and mine-laying equipment. The diving depth was 30 to 75 metres, the surface speed was 18 knots, and when submerged 7.5 to 8.5 knots. The size of the crew numbered between 20 to 40. 

During the First World War Britain lost 54 submarines but by 1918 had 137 in service with another 78 under construction. The German Navy had 134 operational U-boats and these managed to sink 192 boats, killing more than 5,400 people.

During the Second World War the marines were reorganized as the Marine Amphibious Corps (October 1942). Under the leadership of General Holland Smith, the Marine Corps employed a force of over 450,000 men and was primarily employed as the spearhead of the amphibious operation in the Pacific.

The Marine Corps had 10,412 pilots. Of the five marine air wings, four were combat groups while the 9th Wing remained in the United States as a training unit.

Simplicissimus was opposed to the foreign policy of the German government before the outbreak of the First World War. However, once fighting began, Simplicissimus gave its full support to the war effort. Ludwig Thoma, the editor, later reported: "All of us had supported peace. With no cautious reservations we had denounced the personal rule and all its harmful manifestations. But once the war was there nothing mattered but our own country." 

Ludwig Thoma called a meeting where he suggested that the journal should close down as : "there was no place for a satirical sheet which opposed the ruling powers of Germany." Thomas Heine disagreed and argued that it was important that Simplicissimus should continue as the "Fatherland needed a periodical of such international prestige to support the war effort." The majority of the staff agreed and it was published throughout the war. 

Ludwig Thoma joined the German Army and during the war and in 1917 wrote to a friend and denounced his earlier work with Simplicissimus: "I used to shout my mouth off. This now seems immature and deplorable. Belief and criticism are incompatible."

After the Armistice Simplicissimus led the campaign against the Versailles Treaty. Ludwig Thoma, its editor, had served in a medical unit during the war. He no longer held liberal views and instead joined a right-wing group called Deutsche Vaterlandspartei.

On 22 May 1941, the type VIIC German submarine U-571 was commissioned under the command of Kapitänleutnant (English equivalent Lieutenant) Helmut Möhlmann. Under his command U-571 had nine successful patrols in the Arctic, and the North and Central Atlantic. In August and September 1941, U-571 operated against Allied and Soviet forces sinking the Soviet passenger vessel Marija Uljanova on 26 August.

After Oberleutnant zur See (English equivalent Lieutenant Junior Grade) Gustov Lüssow took command on 2 May 1943, U-571 patrolled off the west coast of Africa in July 1943 before returning to base on 1 September 1943. Between September and December, U-571 was probably being overhauled in a drydock as no mention of the boat for that time period appears in war diary kept by the German Commander in Chief, Submarines, Admiral Doenitz. On 18 January 1944, Lüssow reported to his submarine command that he attacked and sank on unknown destroyer, however this could not be verified to any known Allied losses during World War II. On 28 January 1944 in the North Atlantic, U-571 sank on its eleventh war patrol after fighting on the surface with an Australian Sunderland aircraft from RAAF 461 Squadron. The aircraft pilot noted that most of the crew got into the water, but froze in the cold water. U-571 is listed as sinking with all hands at 52.41N; 14.27W.

Destroyers were small, fast warships that were developed as defence for battlefleets against the new threat of torpedo boats. Destroyers built just before 1914 were between 500-800 tons and were armed with four to twelve torpedoes. They were generally deployed in flotillas (4 to 20 ships) that accompanied battleships and battlecruisers. Destroyers were also used for anti-submarine work and as minelayers. 

During the First World War nearly 450 destroyers served with the British Navy. Destroyers grew steadily larger and by the end of the war most of the new ships were over 1,000 tons.

Anti-aircraft guns were deployed on ships and around important defensive areas during the Second World War. Light machine-guns were used against low-flying aircraft. Large cannon, with a range of 25,000 feet were employed against fighter planes and heavy bombers. The most effective of these was the Bofors Gun.

Those aircraft that were capable of performing rapid three-dimensional manoeuvres were extremely difficult to hit. So also were high-flying bombers and the main tactic was to throw up an enormous barrage of time-fused shells in front of a bomber formation. This was an expensive operation as research suggests that only one per 2,000 shells hit the target.

Just before the war Robert Watson-Watt, designed and installed a chain of radar stations along the East and South coast of England. During the Battle of Britain and the Blitz these stations were able to detect enemy aircraft at any time of day and in any weather conditions. 

All countries used barrage balloons to channel aircraft into corridors of fire. During night raids searchlights were used to pick out individual targets. The British also used radar to help gunners to calculate quickly and accurately the speed and course of their targets.

Small ships carried light machine-guns but larger ships employed 20-40mm cannon against dive-bombers such as the Junkers Stuka. In the later stages of the war the Japanese Navy used phosphorous rockets against enemy aircraft.

In 1943 the Allies began using proximity fuses. These contained a small radio transmitter which detonated the shell on interference from a nearby aircraft. These were used against the V1 Flying Bomb in 1944.

The fighter airplane, which was primarily designed to destroy other aircraft in combat, was introduced in the first World War, but did not played a key role until World War II.  They were often the highest performing aircraft of their times, capable of outflying and outmaneuvering opposing fighters.  They were armed with weapons specially designed to hit enemy aircraft, such as rapid-fire machine guns.

During World War II, all-metal, propeller-engine fighters were capable of speeds of 450 miles and reached ceilings of 35,000 to 40,000 feet.  Some of the more notable fighters from that period were the British Spitfire and Hurricane, the U.S. P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang, the German Focke Wulf FW-190 and the Japanese Zero.  Uses of fighters included air support for naval sorties, reconnaissance, light bombing runs, dogfighting, harassment and support for ground attacks.

The Messerschmitt Bf 109 was designed by Willy Messerschmitt and Walter Rethel and had its first test flight in 1935. The all-metal aircraft had a closed cockpit and a retractable under-carriage. Powered by a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V engine, it had a maximum speed of 342 mph (550 km) and had a range of 410 miles (660 km). It was 28 ft 4 in (8.65 m) long with a wingspan of 32 ft 4 in (9.87 m). The aircraft was armed with 2 machine-guns and 2 20 mm cannons.

At the International Air Show in Zurich in July 1937, the BF 109 with a modified engine, set a world record of 379.39 mph. Until the Battle of Britain the BF 109 was considered the best fighter aircraft in the world. 

The BF 109, like its main rival, the Supermarine Spitfire, was continually improved throughout the Second World War. Messerschmitt A. G. produced over 35,000 for the Luftwaffe between 1936 and 1945.

Throughout the Second World War both the Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe attempted to produce an effective jet fighter. The Messerschmitt 262A made its first test flight on 18th July, 1942. It reached a speed of 540 mph (869 km) making it faster than any other aeroplane in the air during the Second World War. The aircraft was armed with four 30 mm cannons.

Hermann Goering believed that the aircraft had the potential to change the course of the war. However, production was delayed when Adolf Hitler insisted that they should be used as a bomber rather than a fighter aircraft. Underwing bomb-racks were fitted and the first of these planes were not delivered to the Luftwaffe until April 1944. Of the 1,430 produced only 220 were operational before the end of the war. Of these, 120 were shot down by Allied fighters.

Reginald J. Mitchell developed a racing seaplane, the Supermarine S6B, which won the Schneider Trophy on 13th September, 1931. During the contest the aircraft reached 340 mph (547 km/h). 

In 1934 the Air Ministry announced that it was looking for a new fighter plane. Mitchell, whose company was now part of Vickers Aviation, decided to adapt his Supermarine seaplane, in an attempt to meet the requirements of the Royal Air Force. 

The new all-metal single-seater fighter plane, the Supermarine Spitfire Mk. I, had several technical features of the earlier racing seaplane. It had the same structure and aerodynamic lines. However, it had a new engine, the 1,030 hp Rolls Royce Merlin II and carried 8 machine-guns. 

The first Spitfire prototype appeared on 5th March, 1936 and flew at 350 mph (563 km/h) and could ascend at approximately 2,500 ft (762 m) per minute. With its slender aerodynmamic lines and elliptical-plan wings, it was claimed at the time, to be the smallest and cleanest aircraft that could be constructed around a man and an engine.

The Royal Air Force was impressed with its performance and in June, 1936, it ordered 310 aircraft. The Supermarine Spitfire Mk. I went into production in 1937 and was operational in June, 1938. Vickers Aviation could not keep up with demand and most of Britain's manufacturers began building Spitfires. By October, 1939, the Air Ministry had ordered over 4,000 of these aeroplanes.

The P-51A Mustang was designed by Raymond Rice and Edgar Schmued for the North American Aviation Company in 1940. 

Its first flight took place on 26th October, 1940. The Royal Air Force was impressed with its performance an placed an order for 320 aircraft. The aircraft had a maximum speed of 390 mph (628 km) and had a range of 730 miles (1,200 km). It was 32 ft 3 in (2.65 m) long with a wingspan of 37 ft (11.28 m). The aircraft was armed with 4 machine-guns and could carry 1,000 lb (454 kg) of bombs. 

The Royal Air Force ordered more and 820 were delivered in October 1941. The North American Aviation Company continued to work on improving the aircraft and in 1943 began producing the P-51B Mustang. This new aircraft could reach a speed of 440 mph (710 km) at 30,000 ft (9,000). 

A total of 15,469 Mustangs were built between 1940 and 1945. It destroyed 4,950 enemy aircraft in air combat and 4,131 on the ground. They were used extensively to protect bombers on raids over Germany. 

During the Second World War the Mustang flew on 213,873 missions in Europe. It was also used by the United States Air Force during the Korean War.

Under the command of Alexander Novikov, the Red Air Force gradually gained air supremacy on the Eastern Front. With over 10,000 front-line aircraft, the Soviets easily outnumbered the Luftwaffe. 

With the Red Army advancing on Berlin in 1945, the Red Air Force was able to employ 800 heavy bombers to join the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force in attacking Nazi Germany. 

A total of 45,000 Soviet aircraft were destroyed by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. As well as building 81,000 aircraft the Soviets also imported 18,000 aircraft from the United States and Britain.

In August, 1934 the Boeing Aircraft Company began work on producing a multi-engined bomber for the United States Air Force. The specifications provided by the USAF included an aircraft that could carry 2,000 pounds of bombs a distance of 2,000 miles at speeds of 240 mph. 

The B-17 Flying Fortress flew for the first time on 28th July, 1935. The aircraft, with its nine man crew, had a maximum speed of 317 mph (510 km) and had a range of 3,000 miles (4,800 km). It was 73 ft 10 in (9.83 m) long with a wingspan of 103 ft (31.62 m). The aircraft was armed with 10 machine-guns and could carry 17,600 lb (7.985 kg) of bombs. 

When the B-17 entered service in June, 1939, it was the most advanced bomber in the world. On 17th August, 1942, it began making its first bombing raids in Europe. Whereas the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax concentrated on night raids on Nazi Germany the B-17 took responsibility for the daylight bombing campaign.

The B-17 was constantly improved during the Second World War. The entire rear section was radically altered to provide greater stability at high altitude. The armament was increased and included two mechanically operated gun turrets. The B-17G version had an increased range of 3,400 miles (5,200 km) and carried a crew of ten. 

A total of 12,731 B-17s were produced during the war. The Royal Air Force received over 200 of these and was used by Bomber Command over Germany.

The Red Air Force was not an independent service and was controlled by the Red Army and the Red Navy. By 1936 Soviet factories were producing about 3,500 aircraft a year. The most important of these were the bombers Tupolev TB-3 and the Tupolev SB-2. By 1941 the Red Air Force possessed a total of 18,000 aircraft and employed 20,000 pilots and a further 180,000 personnel. 

When Adolf Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, one of the main objectives was to put the Red Air Force out of action. On the first day the 3,000 Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed 1,200 Soviet aircraft, 800 of them being on the ground at the time.

As factories in the Soviet Union had to be moved to the east, it was not until the following year that the Red Air Force was able to build up its resources. A total of 8,000 aircraft were built in 1942. This was increased to 18,000 in 1943 and 30,000 in 1944. 

New aircraft built during the Second World War included the fighters Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, Lavochkin LaGG-3, Yakovlev Yak-1 and the Ilyushin Il-10. Important bombers built during this period included Petlyakov Pe-2 and the Tupolev Tu-2.

After Adolf Hitler obtained power in 1933, the German government was open about its tank production. In the spring of 1934 the German Army began using the Panzer I tank. The following year the Panzer II appeared. 

The third tank to be introduced in 1937 was the Panzer IV. This was to eventually become the backbone of the Panzer force and more of this type was built than any other. Produced by Krupp it weighed 17.3 tons and was armed with a short 75mm gun in the turret, plus two machine guns, and a crew of five men. The armour protection ranged from 8mm to 30mm in thickness. The 230hp engine gave it a speed of 18mph.

During the invasion of Poland in September, 1939, it became clear that the Panzer I was insufficiently armed for battle conditions. Panzer II and Panzer III tanks were reliable but were outgunned. The outstanding performer was the Panzer IV as it had the perfect combination of speed, agility, firepower and reliability. Over the next few years Germany produced over 9,000 of these tanks. 

The Panzer IV performed so well during the invasions of Poland and France that little tank development took place during the next year. However, the problems encountered during Operation Barbarossa resulted in the production of the Panther and it eventually became Germany's most important tank.

In the first three years of the Second World War the main tanks used by the German Army were the Panzer IV and the Panther Tank. However, the successful resistance of the Red Army in the Soviet Union in 1942 showed that new tanks were needed. 

In 1943 the German Army began using the Tiger Tank. Produced by Henschel it weighed 55 tons and had armour 25mm to 100mm thick. It had a 88mm gun and its 700hp motor enabled it to reach speeds of 23mph. 

The Tiger Tank did not perform well in battle conditions and overheated and had serious suspension problems. Eventually it was replaced by Tiger II. Weighing 70 ton with a 128mm gun it became known as King Tiger.

In April 1934 the British General Staff discussed a proposal put forth by General Sir Hugh Elles of the Royal Tank Corps that covered the specs for an "Infantry" tank, well protected, with MG as armament and go as fast as infantry on foot. Sir John Carden led the design team. Prototypes were given to the army for trials in September 1936. Costs were kept down by using a commercial Ford engine and transmission. The crew was limited to 2 because of severe cost restrictions, and thus there wasn't enough in the budget for 2 in the cast turret.

The steering, brake and clutches were adapted from the Vickers light tanks. Named after a cartoon duck. Production order for 60 was placed in April 1937. The first models were delivered in 1938 to the 1st Army Tank Brigade.

Went with 4th and 7th Royal Tank Regiment, and 1st Army Tank Brigade to France in 1940 and took part in battle of Arras. After Dunkirk remaining vehicles used for training.

In March 1941 the United States Army decided it needed a new tank to replace the Grant M2A1. After looking at five different proposals the Sherman M4 was chosen. Production began early in 1942. The original armament was a 75mm gun capable of firing high explosive shells. Its 500hp engine had a maximum speed of 26mph. This was replaced by a 76mm high-velocity gun in February 1944. The tank's suspension was redesigned and improved by the beginning of 1945.

Although inferior to the best German and Soviet tanks in armament and protection, it was superior in terms of reliability, serviceability and cost-effectiveness. The British Army used the Sherman Tank at El Alamein in 1942 and by 1943 was the mainstay of Allied operations in Africa and Europe.

In 1937 the Kharkov Tank Factory in the Soviet Union began work on a new "shellproof" tank. Instructions were given to design a tank that could be mass-produced and would be easy to maintain during battle. The T-34 was accepted by the Red Army in December 1939 and by Operation Barbarossa 1,225 had been built. The T-34 was provided with sloped armour to deflect shells that was welded instead of riveted. Fitted with a powerful diesel engine, its main armament was a high-velocity 76mm gun. 

The existence of the T-34 was kept a secret and the German 17th Panzer Division was shocked to discover their shells bouncing off the tank's armour when it was used for the first time in June, 1941. It was clear that the ability to produce large numbers of the T-34 would be vital if the Red Army was to prevent the Germans occupying the Soviet Union. As the German Army threatened to overrun the Kharkov Tank Factory in the autumn of 1941, the factory was moved east and reassembled at Nizhni-Tagil. 

The Germans attempted to develop anti-tank guns that could destroy the T-34. The Soviets responded by improving the tank. Soviet tank commanders complained he turret was the most vulnerable part of the vehicle. It was discovered that the turret on the KV-IC tank was better and this was now used on the T-34. The new turret was mounted with an 85mm gun and the armour thickness was increased to 110mm on the front and 90mm on the turret. A new five-speed gearbox was also installed.

During the Second World War the Kharkov Tank Factory produced 40,000 T-34 tanks. In the opinion of many experts, the T-34 was the best designed tank of the war.

KV series of tanks were named after Klementi Voroshilov, the minister of defence in the Soviet Union during the Second World War. The KV-1 was first used in the Russo-Finnish War in 1939. Armed with a 76.2mm gun of 30 calibers in length, weighed 46 tons, had a crew of five men, and was propelled by a 550hp diesel engine. Its frontal armour was 77mm and made the KV-1 resistant to most anti-tank weapons. 

An improved model, KV-1A, that had a longer (40 calibers) 76mm gun, was introduced in 1940. The following year the KV-1B was developed and was given additional armour at the front and sides to give a thickness of 100mm. 

The German Army found it difficult to cope with the KV tank during Operation Barbarossa. Even so, the Soviets continued to improve the vehicle and in 1942 the KV-1C was introduced. It had a new 600hp engine and its armour was now 130mm thick. The tracks were made wider to give better performances in mud and snow. 

In 1943 the Red Army got the KV-85. These used the same chassis as the KV-1C but was fitted with a high-velocity 85mm anti-aircraft gun. The tank remained in service until the end of the war.

The M3A1 halftrack was a specially designed commercial front and rear drive truch chassis. Some models had a roller on the front to help it climb out of ditches, and others had a winch for towing the vehicle out of soft terrain. With the tracks it could go over rougher terrain than an armored car. 

The radiator was protected by armored shutters that could be opened, closed, or put in 3 different positions from within the vehicle by the driver. The shutter had direct vision slots for use when it was closed. The windshield has shatter proof glass that could be removed when entering a combat zone.

[UNIT_BATTLECRUISER_WAW_HISTORICAL]
A battlecruiser had the speed of a cruiser and the striking power of a battleship. It was Admiral John Fisher, the First Sea Lord, who first suggested the idea of battlecruisers. The first three battlecruisers; Invincible, Indomitable and Inflexible, were completed was the Royal Navy in 1908. Fisher argued that if a battlecruiser could not destroy a battleship it was attacking, it would always be fast enough to escape. The Germany Navy followed Britain's example and also began building battlecruisers. 

In 1912 produced three new battlecruisers that became known as the Big Cats (Lion, Queen Mary and the Princess Royal). The Queen Mary, with its 13.5-inch guns, was the largest ship in the Royal Navy. 

Events in the First World War revealled that although battlecruisers could be impressive in attack, they had defensive weaknesses. Inflexible was badly damaged by a mine at Gallipoli and Invincible exploded and sank after a hit from a German ship during the Battle of Jutland. Queen Mary was also sunk at Jutland with the loss of almost 1,300 lives. 

The Hood was considered Britain's greatest battlecruiser. Her construction was begun in 1916 and she was completed in August 1918. Her armament consisted of eight 15-inch guns (380 mm) placed in four turrets. There were also twelve 5.5 inch guns (140 mm) and four anti-aircraft 4 inch guns (102 mm). The Hood had two underwater and four surface 21 inch torpedo tubes (533 mm). The maximum speed was 31 knots and had a crew of 1,341 men.

The first cruisers were built around 1880. Cruisers were smaller than battleships but were designed to be faster. They were basically large fast ocean-going warships. Cruisers had a top speed of around 30 knots and had a crew of roughly 600 men. There were two main types of cruisers. The first was known as the heavy armoured cruiser. It was generally 10,000 tones in weight and had very strong side armour. It was mainly designed to be an assistant alongside the bigger battleships in battles with other fleets. The Royal Navy built 42 armoured cruisers between 1885 and 1907. After this date armoured cruisers were gradually replaced by battlecruisers. The other type was known as a protected cruiser. This vessel's weight could range from anywhere between 2,000 and 14,000 tones. These cruisers had deck armour but had absolutely no side armour which was a major problem if these boats became involved in sea battles. The main tasks of these vessels included guarding trade routes, troop-ships and outposts. Between 1885 and 1907 the Royal Navy built 101 protected cruisers. 

The wartime-designed cruisers were made much lighter and faster and were mainly intended for scouting and screening operations. These boats were built in great numbers by both English and German fleets and played an important role in all the major North Sea battles during the First World War. 

Older cruisers were kept busy during the war as they were used as protection against the German surface raiders. The got a helping hand from old passenger liners that had been converted into armed merchant cruisers. In the latter part of the war old British cruisers were used as long-range convoy escorts.

The PT boat was a high-speed attack boat primarily used by the United States Navy in the early to mid-20th century.  It was armed with two to four torpedoes, several depth charges and 20-mm and 40-mm guns.  Typically crewed by 14 soldiers, they averaged about 80 feet in length and could travel up to 40 knots.  They were fast, maneuverable, and very effective at night missions.

The Patrol Torpedo (PT) Boat evolved out of the American Civil War era practice of deploying ordinary boats to plant explosives on enemy ships at anchor under the cover of darkness.  In 1935, Britain built what became known as the motor torpedo boat: a high-speed attack boat adept at swift attacks, especially on submarines.  In 1938, PT boats modeled after the British type entered service in the U.S. Navy.  They played an important role in combat around the Philippine Islands in World War II, but most were removed from the Navy's active list after the war due to their short cruising range and inability to operate in rough seas.  About 25 PT boats, modified for speed (by removing the torpedoes) were active in the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1968 but fell out of action and were eventually phased out as other ships, such as destroyers, diversified their arsenals and capabilities.

Work began on Ark Royal in 1934 and was completed four years later. On the outbreak of the Second World War she was the only modern aircraft carrier available to the Royal Navy . She was fast, manoevrable and well-armed and at the time was considered to be the world's most outstanding ship.

In 1940 Ark Royal saw action in Norway and then took part in the attacks on the Vichy bases at Mers-el-Kébir (6th July, 1940) and Dakar (23rd September, 1940). Ark Royal also played an important role in the sinking of the Bismarck on 26th May, 1941.

Over the next few months Ark Royal operated in the Mediterranean. On 13th November 1941 she was hit by a torpedo 30 miles off Gibraltar. Badly damaged she sank the following day with the loss of only one crew member.

J. Robert Oppenheimer was made director of the Los Alamos lab, and in 1943 he gathered about 200 of the best scientists in the field to live and work there. They designed two bombs, one using uranium (called "Little Boy") and one using plutonium ("Fat Man"). By early 1945, the plants at Oak Ridge and Hanford had produced enough raw material for testing. On July 13, 1945, at a site called Trinity 200 km southwest of Alamogordo, a plutonium bomb was assembled and brought to the top of a tower. The test was postponed by thunderstorms. On July 16, the bomb was detonated, producing an intense flash of light seen by observers in bunkers 10 km away and a fireball that expanded to 600 meters in two seconds. It grew to a height of more than 12 kilometers, boiling up in the shape of a mushroom. Forty seconds later, the blast of air from the bomb reached the observation bunkers, along with a long and deafening roar of sound. The explosive power, equivalent to 18.6 kilotons of TNT, was almost four times larger than predicted.

Some of the Los Alamos scientists had circulated a petition asking President Truman to give Japan a warning and a chance to surrender before using the bomb. Some signed, some didn't, but the project remained a secret until the end.

Twenty-one days after the test, the B-29 bomber Enola Gay dropped the uranium bomb on Hiroshima, Japan. Three days later the plutonium bomb was used to bomb Nagasaki. The two bombs killed approximately 150,000 people when they fell. Earlier in the year, intense bombing of Tokyo with conventional bombs had killed about 100,000 people without causing Japan to surrender, but on August 15, 1945, Japan officially surrendered, bringing an end to World War II.

During World War II, military forces deployed parachute-equipped infantrymen called paratroopers.  Planes laden with paratroopers could fly deep behind the front lines of conflict and drop directly on enemy emplacements.  They could be used to interrupt supply lines, strike command centers, conduct reconnaissance and, perhaps most important, capture and hold crucial objectives like bridges and key terrain.  Aircraft also enabled infantry to deploy quickly over a larger area.  Paratroopers and airmobile forces became vital to peacekeeping and humanitarian missions beyond the reach of conventional, land-based transportation.  One of the most famous uses of paratroopers occurred on June 6, 1944 in the invasion of Normandy, France.  Allied paratroopers landed behind enemy lines before sunrise and covertly secured strategic areas to make it easier for other soldiers to come ashore from boats.

[CONCEPT_ANCIENT_AGE_HISTORICAL]
The Ancient Age represented the first iterations of human societies.  Across the world peoples began to abandon nomadic life in favor of settling near a river or fertile plain.  The discovery of agriculture, in part, made settlement possible, giving people the power to expand their tribe by feeding greater numbers of people.  Religion was often a major part of ancient societies, unifying people in times of struggle and uncertainty.  Jurisprudence, philosophy, drama and writing enriched ancient civilizations, proving social order, entertainment and intellectual stimulation.  Ancient times were marked by brutal and bloody conflicts, as nations sought to expand their territories and conquer their enemies.  Advancements in bronze and iron working, ship building and siege weapons fueled an almost constant state of war throughout the last four millennia BC.

[CONCEPT_ATROCITY_GAMEPLAY]
Atrocities are events so abominable and horrifying, they provoke the anger and condemnation of the world community.

Players should consider this when building and deploying weapons of mass destruction.  Although such devices can be extraordinarily efficient and destructive means, in the end, the diplomatic consequences of atrocities may far outweigh the tactical benefits.

Barbarians are units that have no affiliation with any established empire on the map.  They roam the map and are hostile to any other unit or city they encounter.  Players should exercise caution, particularly in the early stages of building his or her empire, when dealing with Barbarians.

If a Barbarian unit manages to enter a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e>, it seizes control of it.

At the beginning of the game, players may choose between 4 different levels of Barbarian presence in the game - Ruins Only, Bandits, Raiders and Marauders.  Each level has a graduated effect on the difficulty of the game.

Cities, and the management of them, are the prime focus of Call To Power II.  With them, players can build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_UNITS>Units<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> and Wonders.  They draw the three main resources, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e>, from the surrounding tiles.  As the population of a city expands, so does its influence.  Larger cities have more tiles from which to extract resources.

Building cities is the only way to expand an empire.  The more cities an empire has, the more terrain it controls, the more units it can build, and the more resources it has at its disposal.

The efficiency of one's cities can mean the difference between victory and defeat.  Players should strive to completely master the particulars of city management, including placement on terrain, use of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Buildings<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e> and controlling <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>.

[CONCEPT_COMMERCE_GAMEPLAY]
Commerce is one of the basic resources of the game.  Commerce represents the activity of buying, selling and trading goods and services in a city.  It produces <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e>, which pays for workers' <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WAGES>Wages<e> and funds <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SCIENCE>Science<e>.

Commerce is one of the three basic resources in Call To Power II.  All <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> generate Commerce by working the tiles of land in and around the city.  The city limits (represented by a white dotted line drawn on the map) indicate from which tiles a city draws Commerce.  Terrain types have varying levels of Commerce, and certain <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e>, like the <L:DATABASE_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS,TILEIMP_TRADING_POST>Trading Post<e> and <L:DATABASE_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS,TILEIMP_OUTLET_MALL>Shopping Mall<e>, can help a city increase the amount of Commerce it creates. 

In order to discover <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advances<e>, one must fund scientific research.  Leaders may adjust the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SCIENCE_SETTING>Science Setting<e>, which determines what percentage of total Commerce goes to research.

Commerce represents the economic vitality of a city.  Cities draw on their Commerce to pay for maintenance costs on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>.  Cities may increase their Commerce by building <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> like <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_BANK>Banks<e> and <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_BROKERAGE>Brokerage Houses<e>.  They can also assign <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SPECIALISTS>Workers<e> to be <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SPECIALISTS>Merchants<e>.

To control the distribution of wealth in an empire, players can set the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WAGES>Wages<e> level for each citizen.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WAGES>Wages<e> level has a direct impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>, so it is wise to not underpay one's citizens.

[CONCEPT_DIAMOND_AGE_HISTORICAL]
The Diamond Age was a period of intense scientific breakthroughs.  With the perfecting of nanotechnology and further developments in genetics, human beings possessed power over their lives and their worlds in ways that seemed unfathomable in previous centuries.  Human cloning and life extension enabled people to achieve immortality, as the limitations of the physical body no longer presented an obstacle.   More than any other science, nanotechnology affected the lives of citizens most profoundly.  Sub-microscopic machines called nanites could manipulate molecules, seek out nuclear weapons, eat pollution, release toxins and countless other tasks.  With the aid of nanites, entire cities were constructed underwater.  The power of nanites manifest in two disparate realms, however, and represented both the future and the demise of human life.  The Gaia Controller had the power to grant a new utopia in the world, by providing limitless supplies of resources.  However, Eco-Rangers could just as easily obliterate entire cities in a matter of minutes, leaving behind only pristine wilderness.  Though some saw this as a triumph, others feared the day that human beings sought to undue six millennia of evolution, progress and creation.  For all of its technological breakthroughs, the Diamond Age represented a world at a crossroads.  With the power of eternal life, limitless energy, and an end to material scarcity, people were finally in control of every aspect of their own destinies.  The only question that remained was whether people would live in peace or ultimately destroy themselves in the acts of nanotechnological war.

[CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY_GAMEPLAY]
Diplomacy is the art of negotiation.  It is also one of the central foci of the game.  Once a player makes contact with a foreign empire, he or she may engage in basic diplomatic relations.  <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_ESTABLISH_EMBASSY>Establishing Embassies<e> in foreign <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> open up more diplomatic options.

In Call To Power II, Diplomacy is conducted by sending proposals to other players.  Players can comprise diplomatic proposals from the following options: <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_OFFER>Offers<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REQUEST>Requests<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TREATIES>Treaties<e>.  Players comprise a proposal of any two of these elements, in any order, one in exchange for the other (e.g. a player may make an offer and request something in exchange, or propose a treaty in exchange for an offer.) The recipient weighs his or her own interests and agreements and responds by either accepting, rejecting or countering the proposal.

A player also has the option to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_THREAT>Threaten<e> the recipient should they disagree to the terms of their proposal.

Players can select the tone of voice with which they write the proposal.  A player should select his or her <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TONE>Tone<e> based on the recipient's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e> for them, because it can affect whether the recipient receives the proposal favorably, tentatively or rejects it outright.   Since Diplomacy has a considerable impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e>, it can be the key to keeping strong enemies at bay, exchanging <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e> for <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advances<e>, forging <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TREATIES>Military Agreements<e>, preserving peace and maintaining worldwide environmental standards.

The <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_VICTORY_DIPLOMATIC>World Peace Victory<e> is only attainable by the player who shrewdly engages his or her rivals in Diplomacy to the benefit of the world.  Once all nations form an <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ALLIANCE>Alliance<e> with the player, he or she wins the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_VICTORY_DIPLOMATIC>World Peace Victory<e>.

The size of one's empire, measured in the number of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e>, is only of concern when it comes to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type.  Not all <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Governments<e> are adequate for large empires.

If a player's empire is too large for the current <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type, the citizens will become <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Unhappy<e>.

[CONCEPT_FOOD_GAMEPLAY]
Food is one of the fundamental resources of the game.  All <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> grow and harvest Food by working the tiles of land in and around the city.  The city limits (represented by a white dotted line drawn on the map) indicate from which tiles a city draws Food.  Different terrain types grow varying levels of Food, and <L:DATABASE_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS,TILEIMP_FARMS>Farm<e> <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> can help a city increase their Food production.  

If a city produces more Food than it consumes, it will store it.  If a city begins consuming more than it can produce, it will draw from any available food stores.  If it depletes its stores, the city will starve and people will die, reducing population.

To control the distribution of Food at the empire level, the player can set the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RATIONS>Rations<e> level for each citizen.  The higher the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RATIONS>Rations<e> level, the more Food is distributed and the quicker food stores are depleted.  If an empire's Food production cannot support the rations level, it will be automatically decreased.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_RATIONS>Rations<e> level has a direct impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>.

With the deciphering of the mysteries of human life at the hands of researchers involved in the Human Genome Project, the Genetic Age built on the solid foundation of scientific achievement established in the Modern Age.  What distinguished the Genetic Age from the Modern Age was an collective increase in responsibility towards humanity and the environment.  Whereas technology continued to streamline the process of manufacturing, it also found equally powerful ways to help curb pollution.  Human mastery of the physical world continued at breakneck pace with the applications of chaos theory and unified physics.  More than anything else, the achievements of the Genetic Age began to blur the lines between human and machine.  Neural interfaces enabled people to control computers with their thoughts.  Medical scientists began to apply their knowledge of genetics towards not only the eradication of disease but the customization of all forms of life.  As the computer revolutionized the lives of people in the 20th century, so did genetics irrevocably alter life in the 21st century.

[CONCEPT_GOLD_GAMEPLAY]
Gold is the currency of Call to Power II, and one of the key resources in the game.  It is used to speed up <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_UNITS>Unit<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvement<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonder<e> production times by allowing the player to rush buy an item in the build queue.

The most common way to generate Gold in one's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> is through Commerce.  Like <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> or <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> is one of the three basic elements that a city can extract from tiles within its area of influence.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, such as <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_BROKERAGE>Brokerages<e>, can also increase the amount of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e>, and therefore Gold, a city produces.

Trade is the other common way to produce Gold.  A robust and vibrant web of trade routes can bring in substantial profits.  In <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>Diplomacy<e>, empires can offer or request Gold in exchange for advances, actions and diplomatic favor.

They range from natural resources like <L:DATABASE_RESOURCE,TERRAIN_DESERT_GOOD_TWO>Oil<e> and <L:DATABASE_RESOURCE,TERRAIN_WATER_SHALLOW_GOOD_TWO>Pearls<e> to processed goods like <L:DATABASE_RESOURCE,TERRAIN_MOUNTAIN_GOOD_ONE>Tea<e> and <L:DATABASE_RESOURCE,TERRAIN_GRASSLAND_GOOD_TWO>Tobacco<e>.  Each terrain type has a common good, which has a higher chance of appearing, and a rare good.  A good on a tile within the range of influence of a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e> enables that city to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE>Trade<e> that Good.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE>Trade<e> generates profits for the city, in the form of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e>.

If one <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TERRAFORM>Terraforms<e> a tile with a Good on it, that Good is permanently eradicated.  If a tile with a Good on it becomes a dead tile, the Good is lost as well.

[CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS_GAMEPLAY]
Government is the complex of political institutions, laws, and customs through which the function of governing is carried out.  

Twelve distinct government types vary from each other based on several criteria:  Max Cities, Growth Rating, Production Rank, Science Rank, Economic Rank, Commerce Efficiency, Military Support, Martial Law, National Loyalty and Anti-Pollution Measures.
[END]

[CONCEPT_GROWTH_GAMEPLAY]
The Growth Rating indicates how quickly <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> increase their <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_POPULATION>Population<e>.  Several factors contribute to the growth rate, including the distribution of labor in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> that promote growth and the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type under which a leader rules his or her empire.  Cities that produce an abundance of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> will grow quicker than <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> that produce merely adequate amounts of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>.

[CONCEPT_HAPPINESS_GAMEPLAY]
Each city has an individual Happiness rating that indicates how satisfied citizens are with their lives.  The empire-wide Happiness indicator reflects the general disposition of one's empire as a whole.  Wise leaders will maintain the Happiness of their people by providing them with as much <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>, as short a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e> and as high a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WAGES>Wage<e> as possible.  They can increase Happiness with religion- and entertainment-oriented <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>.  Other factors, such as <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_POLLUTION>Pollution<e>, war and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_OVERCROWDING>Overcrowding<e> of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> also have an impact on Happiness.

The disposition of one's citizens is an important thing to monitor in Call To Power II.  An effective leader strives to act in the best interests of his or her people, and always has their Happiness in mind.  Leaders who do not meet the needs and desires of their people cultivate an embittered, resentful, and even angry populace.  These citizens begin protesting and rioting to express their discontent.  Eventually, if their cries go unanswered, they rise up in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REVOLUTION>Revolution<e> and take control of their own destinies.

Improvements are the structures and systems that comprise a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e>.  In their infancy, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> are little more than a loose collection of dwellings.  Improvements make the city more efficient and enable citizens to generate more <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_COMMERCE>Commerce<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e>.  Improvements can also help reduce <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CRIME>Crime<e>, increase or decrease <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_POLLUTION>Pollution<e>, and make citizens <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happy<e>.

Improvements do not come without a price.  A city must build them from the pool of available <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources, which determines how long it takes to build.  Once complete, each Improvement has a maintenance cost that is paid in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e> from the empire's treasury.  If the cost of maintaining an Improvement is too great, a player can sell the Improvement to raise a little cash.

[CONCEPT_MILITARY_READINESS_GAMEPLAY]
The Military Readiness setting determines the support costs of existing units and affects their health ratings.  There are three military readiness states:  At War, On Alert and At Peace.  

When At War, all units are fully trained and ready to fight.  They incur full support costs and have full health (until attacked).
On Alert status has reduced support costs.  Because of this, unit health suffers a decrease, reflecting the lower level of support.
The At Peace setting reduces unit support costs and health even further.  Therefore, although units are cheaper to maintain at lower readiness levels, they are not as equipped for battle.

It takes several turns to change military readiness settings.  Leaders should consider this when planning their military activity.

[CONCEPT_MODERN_AGE_HISTORICAL]
The Modern Age was marked by an explosion of growth in the areas of human industry and ingenuity.  New manufacturing techniques brought on by the Industrial Revolution contributed to an increase in the productive power of cities.  Breakthroughs in science, such as electricity, quantum physics and modern medicine led to the development of televisions, airplanes and hospitals.  Railroads crisscrossed nearly every continent, expanding the speed and efficacy of transport and travel.  The invention of the internal combustion engine led to the rise of the automobile as the dominant form of land transportation in the mid 20th century.  By the end of the modern age, computers had pervaded every aspect of human life.  They facilitated more rapid scientific research, intercontinental communications, and global commerce.  Despite these leaps in human understanding and productivity, the modern age bore witness to a staggering array of new warfare technology.  From machine guns and tanks to nuclear missiles and stealth aircraft, battlefields heated up as science begat newer and better ways to destroy life.  As technology began to exponentially increase, new questions about the role of technology in society, the responsibility of scientists and even the eventual obsolescence of humanity at the hands of future advances plagued the thinkers of the age.

Leaders who wish to win favor with rival nations may make an Offer in a diplomatic proposal.  An Offer is the opposite of a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REQUEST>Request<e>.

Offers may be gifts, such as a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e>, a sum of <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e> or an Advance.  They may be agreements, like an Offer to give military support or reduce <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_POLLUTION>Pollution<e>.  In a proposal, players may combine them with either a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REQUEST>Request<e> or a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TREATIES>Treaty<e>.

Overcrowding is a by-product of urban <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GROWTH>Growth<e>.  If the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_POPULATION>Population<e> of a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e> grows faster than the city's ability to meet the needs of the population, citizens become unhappy with things like traffic, lack of open space and the fatigue associated with living in a bustling metropolis.

In Call To Power II, there are <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> that can alleviate Overcrowding and the attendant reduction in <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e> it brings.

[CONCEPT_POLLUTION_GAMEPLAY]
Pollution represents the contamination of the environment by physically impure and unclean elements.  It is an unfortunate by-product of human society.  In Call To Power II, there are three Pollution indicators to monitor:  Citywide Pollution, Empire-wide Pollution and Global Pollution.  A good leader can effectively manage Pollution on an Empire and City level.  However, one must use <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>Diplomacy<e> if he or she wants to make an affect on Global Pollution.  Nations may propose Pollution Pacts and demand that they be adhered to.

Some <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, such as <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_FACTORY>Factories<e> and <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_OIL_REFINERY>Oil Refineries<e>, create Pollution, whereas others, like <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_RECYCLING_PLANT>Recycling Plants<e>, reduce it.  Factors such as nuclear warfare can increase Pollution, while some <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e> of the World can help reduce it.

An excess of Pollution will surely upset one's citizens.  The specific Pollution level that they are willing to tolerate depends on one's <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type.

If cities allow pollution to reach toxic levels, the terrain within their area of influence will be damaged beyond use.  Once the Advance <L:DATABASE_ADVANCES,ADVANCE_CONSERVATION>Conservation<e> is discovered, however, these "dead tiles" can be <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TERRAFORM>Terraformed<e> back to useful terrain.

[CONCEPT_PRODUCTION_GAMEPLAY]
Production is one of the three basic resources in Call To Power II.  All <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> generate Production by working the tiles of land in and around the city.  The city limits (represented by a white dotted line drawn on the map) indicate from which tiles a city draws Production.  Different terrain types have varying levels of Production, and mining <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> can help a city increase the amount of Production it creates. 

Production represents the combination of human labor, natural resources and raw materials that are required for industry.  Cities draw on their Production to build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_UNITS>Units<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e>.  Cities may increase their Production by building <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e>.  They can also assign <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORKER>Workers<e> to be <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_SPECIALISTS>Laborers<e>.

In order to build <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS>Tile Improvements<e> and <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TERRAFORM>Terraform<e> tiles, leaders must dedicate a portion of the total Production output of their empire to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PUBLIC_WORKS>Public Works<e>.

To control the productivity of an empire, players can set the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e> level for each citizen.  The longer the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e>, the more <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORKER>Workers<e> produce.  <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WORK_HOURS>Workday<e> length has a direct impact on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>, so it is wise to not overwork one's citizens.

Regard is the worth and estimation that other empires hold for the player.  Empires base their Regard on their level of trust, esteem and respect that they have for other nations and their leaders.  Foreign leaders not only consider how the player acts towards them but how he or she acts towards all nations.  That is why it is important to consider one's actions and the effects on one's reputation.

In Call To Power II, Regard is the key to <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>Diplomacy<e>, and should be carefully monitored if one has any hope of success at the negotiations table.

After the tumult of the Dark Ages in Europe, nations struggled to come to grips with their historical, cultural and national identities.   Particularly in Italy, the Renaissance sparked a renewed interest in the period of Greek and Roman dominance known as the classical period.  As the thinkers of the age grappled with the wisdom of the ancients, they opened up new frontiers in science, art, philosophy and culture.  Mimicking their ancestors' interest in the physical world, the great minds of the Renaissance began to explore the fields of optics, chemistry, physics and astronomy.  Advancements in shipbuilding made larger, more powerful ships available for exploration and warfare.  More than anything, the discovery of gunpowder changed the nature of war.  As strong nations equipped their soldiers with muskets and cannon, cultures still relying on catapults, archers and swordsmen were easily wiped out and conquered.  International trade proliferated as ships laden with exotic goods traveled the seven seas, bringing spices to Europe, muskets to Asia and horses to the New World.

Each specialist is enabled by a specific <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advance<e> and will be unavailable the advance is discovered.

There are five types of specialists:
Entertainers - enabled by <L:DATABASE_ADVANCES,ADVANCE_DRAMA>Drama<e> - Increase <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e> in the city

The more people there are in a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City<e>, the more <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_FOOD>Food<e> the city must produce to feed them.  For each turn a city fails to produce enough food, the city starves.  Each city can endure a state of starvation for up to three turns.  After three turns, the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_POPULATION>city size<e> decreases by one.

Fortunately, there are three <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e> that increase a city's food storage capacity and, therefore, increase a city's starvation "protection."  The <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_GRANARY>Granary<e> increases a city's starvation protection to five turns; the <L:DATABASE_BUILDINGS,IMPROVE_FOOD_SILO>Food Silo<e> increases it to ten turns.

[CONCEPT_STEALTH_UNITS_GAMEPLAY]
Stealth Units are some of the more powerful units in Call To Power II.  Primarily, any entity with normal vision (standard units, cities, listening posts) cannot see stealth units - they are only visible to each other.  In addition, almost all Stealth Units have unconventional attacks.  They can siphon <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOLD>Gold<e>, interrupt <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e>, raise and lower <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_HAPPINESS>Happiness<e>, steal <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advances<e> and information or wage war with weapons of mass destruction.

Players are wise to do everything they can to prevent Stealth Unit attacks.

[CONCEPT_SUPPORT_COST_GAMEPLAY]
Waging war is not without its price.  When a city builds a unit, the cost of that unit is measured in the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources it takes to build it.  Once built, however, the unit incurs an additional cost of maintaining its health and training.  This Military Support cost is extracted from the total <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> output of an empire.  The larger the military, the more strain on <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PRODUCTION>Production<e> resources it has. 

Several things can affect Military Support costs, including <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOVERNMENTS>Government<e> type, <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_WONDERS>Wonders<e> and the <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_MILITARY_READINESS>Military Readiness<e> Setting.

Terraforming is the process of converting one terrain type into another.  As empires expand all over the world, the need for good land becomes dire.  Fortunately, players can use <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_PUBLIC_WORKS>Public Works<e> resources to Terraform undesirable terrain tiles into more useful, more productive land.  As a player progresses through the technology tree, certain key <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_ADVANCES>Advances<e> enable the Terraforming of different terrain types.

[CONCEPT_THREAT_GAMEPLAY]
When a rival empire rejects or counters a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_DIPLOMACY>Diplomatic<e> proposal, a leader may find it necessary to Threaten them with action in order to force them to agree.  Other leaders never take Threats likely, and for good reason.  To Threaten another with, for instance, <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_ATTACK>Attacking<e> a city, or <L:DATABASE_ORDERS,ORDER_INTERCEPT_TRADE>Pirating<e> their trade routes can run the risk of making them angry.  One may jeopardize their diplomatic <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e> if the find themselves in the habit of using Threats often.

[CONCEPT_TILE_IMPROVEMENTS_GAMEPLAY]
Tile Improvements serve several purposes.  Some Tile Improvements, like Roads and Underwater Tunnels, increase mobility and reduce movement costs associated with terrain.  Others, like Farms, Mines and Drilling Platforms, boost the amount of Food, Commerce and Production that Workers collect.  Still, others increase visibility, radar range and defensive capabilities.

The cost of Tile Improvements is drawn from the pool of available Public Works resources, which is, in turn, extracted from the total Production output of an empire.  Unlike city <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_IMPROVEMENTS>Improvements<e>, Tile Improvements do not have a maintenance cost, nor can one sell them.

Leaders must select a Tone of voice for each diplomatic proposal they send, as it has an impact on how the recipient responds.  Players should check their <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_REGARD>Regard<e> with the recipient nation and before selecting Tone.  Misjudging such a thing can prove disastrous to the diplomatic process.  Likewise, players should review the proposals they receive with an ear for Tone.

If a player has <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_GOODS>Goods<e> within their <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>City's<e> area of influence, they can set up a <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_TRADE_ROUTE>Trade Route<e> either within their empire or with a foreign city.

[CONCEPT_TRADE_ROUTE_GAMEPLAY]
Players may create trade routes, in which Caravans (and later, Freight Transports) carry goods between <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> both foreign and domestic.  A line between two <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> indicates a trade route.  Players can tell at a glance what <L:DATABASE_CONCEPTS,CONCEPT_CITY>Cities<e> are trading by a small icon, representing the trade good, which travels along the line.

Empires can pirate the trade routes of their rivals once per turn.  The trade route is not destroyed.  Rather, the pirates abscond with that the profits for that turn.  Piracy is considered an act of aggression and usually has diplomatic consequences.

[GOVERNMENT_ANARCHY_HISTORICAL]
Anarchy was the absence of formal government.  Although many philosophers and political thinkers, particularly 19th century French writer Pierre Joseph Proudhon, considered anarchy a viable alternative to government, it was historically regarded as an undesirable state of lawlessness and chaos.  Its advocates considered the so-called natural laws of man to be sufficient to govern a society, but history has shown that anarchy serves few interests.  

The vacuum of power that existed after the fall of the Roman Empire was a testament to the terrible state of affairs that exists in the absence of a governing body.  The military roamed the countryside commandeering supplies from farms while imperial tax collectors increased their demands.  Farmers, unable to make a living abandoned their fields and went to work for large landholders, or turned to robbery.  Germanic tribes settled in these abandoned lands and established power centers.  Romans experienced food shortages for the first time in centuries, trade became dangerous, commerce collapsed and the complex systems that sustained the vast Roman Empire ceased for lack of support.  Eventually, bitterness and hatred towards authority manifest itself in riots, massacres and widespread crime.

[GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_HISTORICAL]
The essential concept of the republic form of government was that sovereignty resided in the people, who delegated their power to elected representatives and officials.  Historically, this concept was distorted and corrupted, making conventional definition of the term "republic" difficult.  Throughout history, republics took the form of democracies (most notable, the United States) and monarchies, but the term was applied and used by dictatorships, one-party states as well.  The roots of this confusion lie in the origins of the republic.

The concept of the republic (from the Latin res publica, literally "public thing") originated with the two most exceptional thinkers of ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle.  Plato, in his famous work "Republic," presented the ideal state, in the form of the Greek polis ("city-state"), which was based on what he regarded as the basic characteristics of the human soul:  the appetitive, the spirited and the philosophical.  Accordingly, his republic consisted of three groups:  a commercial class comprised of those dominated by their appetites; a spirited class of administrators and soldiers responsible for the execution of laws; and the guardians or philosopher-kings, who would act as lawmakers.  Because Plato empowered the guardians, a small group, with the responsibility of maintaining harmony, republicanism was traditionally associated with goals or policies established by a carefully selected part of the community who presumably had a special insight into what constituted the common good.

Aristotle's concept of republic prevailed in much of the Western world.  He categorized governments based on who ruled:  the one, the few, or the many.  Within these categories, he distinguished good and perverted forms of government, for instance, monarchy (good) compared to tyranny, and aristocracy (good) compared to oligarchy.  His rationale for labeling different governments depended on whether the rulers governed for the good of the state or for their own interests.  Aristotle's distinction between democracy, a perverted form of rule by the many, and polity, the good form, was most relevant to the Western concept of republic.  He maintained that democracies were predisposed to turbulence and instability, because the poor, assumed to be the majority in a democracy, would demand an economic and social equality that stifled individual initiative and enterprise.  Polity, by contrast, would be rule "by the many" without chaos, as its middle class would capably adjudicate conflicts between the rich and the poor.

Theocracies were nations whose religious and state laws were based on the same doctrines.  The separation of the state from the church did not exist.  One of the earliest theocracies rose amidst the chaos after the fall of the Roman Empire, as social institutions, such as education, fell under the aegis of the Roman Catholic church.  Monasteries became the bureaucratic backbone of Europe, handing such things as mail, trade and taxation.  The various "barbarian" states that contributed to the fall of Rome turned to the church for guidance in establishing governments.  Many of them established monarchies loyal to the central theocracy, expanding the power of the church even further.  In the modern era, some Muslim nations established theocracies, ruled by supreme religious figures, and where Islamic law governed every aspect of life.

Tyranny was, in many ways, the oldest form of government.  Tyrants derived their power from nothing more than their ability to physically enforce it.  The tyrant was obligated to his or her subjects for the protection, stewardship and welfare of the people.  Tyranny was always one of the most tenuous forms of government.  Since its basis of power was so easily shaken, tyrants generally did not last long.  They could rarely extract any fealty from their subjects, as they often stayed in charge merely for the lack of sufficient forces to overthrow them.  Furthermore, because tyranny relied on the size and power of the military or police force, larger empires became unmanageable and were subject to revolution.

The original ancient Greek Academeia was located on the northwestern periphery of Athens on a piece of property acquired by Plato in 387 BC.  It consisted of an olive grove, park and gymnasium, and was primarily a college of philosophy.  Organized for the worship of the Muses, the Academy instructed young men in mathematics, dialectics and natural science.  Those who attended were of noble birth as the these schools' primary intent was to prepare patrician boys for lives as statesmen.  A scholarch (or headmaster) was elected for life by a majority of the members of the corporate body that organized the school.  Plato himself taught there until the end of his life, and often gave public lectures on diverse subjects.

The Academy went through many changes of philosophy throughout the centuries of its operation.  It was, but for a brief period in which Arcesilaus ran the school, a center of Platonism until AD 529, when the emperor Justinian closed it and all other pagan schools.  The moniker academy also applied not only to Plato's famous institution but to schools of philosophy during the time of the Roman orator and statesman, Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BC).

[IMPROVE_AIRPORT_HISTORICAL]
Before the introduction of heavy transport monoplanes, such as the Douglas DC-3, in the late 1930s, landing strips did not need to be very long, nor did they have to be paved.  In fact, airports in London (Croydon), Paris (Le Bourget) and Berlin (Tempelhof) used grass strips for both takeoff and landing.  Prewar airfields were situated close to city centers, and were centers of leisure activity, often attracting more visitors than passengers.  In 1939, La Guardia Airport in New York attracted nearly 250,000 visitors per month, reaching a peak of 7,000 in one day, compared with maximum daily number of only 3,000 passengers.  In 1929, Berlin's airport boasted three quarters of a million visitors and prided themselves on a restaurant on the roof of the passenger terminal capable of seating 3,000 people.  Airports were major centers of social activity, and the requirements of aircraft and passengers were ancillary to the need for top-shelf catering, observational decks and other services.

Modern airports grew in the 50s and 60s with the burgeoning of air travel.  By the end of the 20th century, approximately 50 airports around the world handled more than 10 million passengers per year, half of which were in the United States.  Six airports moved 30 million passengers a year, with O'Hare International Airport in Chicago handling 60 million.  Airfields contained several long, paved runways and taxiways to accommodate large, multiple jet- and turboprop-powered transport aircraft.  Extensive ground facilities, fire fighting and rescue services, passenger- and cargo-handling facilities, parking and public transit access, lighting, navigation aids all supported the operation of the airport.  Other facilities, such as catering, shopping, meteorology and government inspection also became essential.  Airports, for convenience's sake, needed to be within reasonable distance of a major urban area, but adequately distant, so that the environmental problems associated with large aircraft and large numbers of passengers, workers and visitors did not become untenable for the cities themselves.

The development of nanotechnology introduced several new ways to dramatically reduce pollution.  The Aqua Filter, invented in the late 21st century, utilized two basic nano-machine types in order to meet the demands of increasingly larger cities for clean, fresh water.  It filtered sewage and agricultural runoff with nanite "scrubbers" that extracted pure water from the waste.  In addition, it deployed nanites into parts of the water supply, which searched for impurities, harmful chemicals and waste products and eliminated them.  This made the city's water supply vastly more reusable, making water available to more people without depleting natural sources of water.

[IMPROVE_AQUEDUCT_HISTORICAL]
Perhaps the most famous Roman masonry achievement was their system of water-bearing aqueducts.  The vast system that served the capital of the Roman Empire was a feat of engineering.  From 312 BC to 226 AD, Roman engineers built 11 aqueducts, some of which remained in use until modern times, designed to bring water to Rome from as far away as 57 miles.  Contrary to modern belief, only about 30 miles of about 260 miles of aqueducts crossed over valleys on stone arches; most of the system consisted of underground conduits made of stone and terracotta pipe, wood, leather, lead and bronze.  Water flowed by the force of gravity alone and usually went through a series of distribution tanks in the city.  Excess water was not stored, but rather used to flush out Rome's elaborate sewer system and supply the famous fountains.  The Romans constructed aqueducts throughout their empire, and remnants of stone arches in Greece, Italy, France, Spain, North Africa and Asia Minor survived well into modern times.

[IMPROVE_ARENA_HISTORICAL]
The Roman Empire created some of largest, most sophisticate entertainment venues in the ancient age.  Arenas and amphitheatres were designed to suit the specific forms of entertainment that the Romans loved, namely, gladiatorial conflicts and venationes, "animal hunts" involving men hunting exotic beasts or, occasionally, beasts hunting each other.  Originally, this kind of entertainment took place in a city's forum, with wooden stands erected to seat spectators.  One of the first permanent entertainment arenas was at Pompeii.  Built around 80 BC, it accommodated about 20,000 spectators.  Other large arenas were found at Verona and Capua.  The most famous arena, the Colosseum, was in Rome itself.  Remains of more than 75 Roman arenas have been found scattered about the Mediterranean, including ones at Nimes and Arles in France, Pula in Istria (Croatia), Thysdrus (El Djem) in Africa and at Caerleon in Gwent, Wales.

An average-sized arena was about 200 to 300 feet long and about 115 to 200 feet wide, and rose 50 to 95 feet about the ground.  Most had a labyrinthine network of passages, cages and rooms all ingeniously connected with the arena above by trap doors.  A system of elevators and machines were used to hoist animals and stage sets through the doors into the arenas.  Around the main arena, a metal screen-topped high wall rose to the spectator seats, which were divided into several sections.  In the lowest section, or podium, the emperor and his attendants sat in a special box.  On the opposite side of the arena sat consuls, praetors, ambassadors, priest, vestal virgins and other persons of distinction.  The rest of the podium contained senators and those of equestrian rank.  The second gallery accommodated patricians, the third plebeians and the fourth, women, who were seated in boxes.  A large awning could be manipulated to shield spectators from the sun.

[IMPROVE_BANK_HISTORICAL]
Little was known about banking before the 13th century, but it was certainly of ancient origin.  Since most of their business was the exchange of foreign and domestic coin of the correct weight and fineness, early banks dealt primarily in coin and bullion.  Merchant bankers dealt in goods as well as bills of exchange, providing for the transfer of money and payment of accounts over great distances without the need for sending coin money.  This was made possible by the fact that many merchants traded internationally and held assets at various points along trade routes.

17th century bankers, particularly the English, began to develop a deposit banking business, and their techniques influenced other banking systems.  London goldsmiths kept money and valuables safe for their customers and dealt in bullion and foreign exchange, making a profit off the acquisition, sorting and exchange of foreign coin.  People began to deposit money with goldsmiths and "money scriveners" (notaries specializing in bringing together borrowers and lenders), and, over time, it was discovered that when a number of people did this, deposits and withdrawals tended to even out.  Customers also began to prefer to leave their surplus money with goldsmiths, keeping only enough for everyday needs.  The resultant fund of idle cash became available for loans, with interest, to other parties.

Around the same time, a new practice emerged whereby a customer could transfer part of his credit balance to another party by addressing an order to the banker.  This was the origin of the modern check, a method of payment that proved so convenient that, in Britain, the public began using checks for most monetary transactions, using coin (and, later, notes) for small payments.  Banks then began granting their borrowers the right to draw checks in excess of their cash holdings, "creating" money in the form of credit.  This money consisted of nothing more than figures in the banks' ledgers, but it was publicly accepted due to confidence in the banks' abilities to honor their liabilities.

[IMPROVE_BASCILICA_HISTORICAL]
Originally, the term "basilica" referred to any of several kinds of large, roofed public buildings in ancient Rome, be they markets, courthouses, promenades or meeting halls.  Eventually, the word began to refer to a specific style of building:  rectangular, with an open hall extending from end to end, usually flanked by side aisles set off by colonnades, with raised platforms at one or both ends.  During the 1st century BC, basilicae were increasingly used for judicial purposes.  The platform was enclosed by a semicircular half-domed protrusion of the end wall called an apse.   The exterior was often simple and unadorned.  The interior, by contrast, often housed elaborate ornamentation on the many wall, ceiling and column surfaces.

The basilica style of building, with its long central hall, aisles and apse, became the blueprint for church buildings in the Western Church.  The Eastern Church, however, embraced a radial style of building, as demonstrated by the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople.  The term basilica evolved once again, and in the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, was a canonical title of honor given to churches of particular distinction.   The Church bestows the title of basilica on sites renowned for either their antiquity, historical significance or association with a major saint.  These churches enjoyed certain privileges, including the right to reserve its high altar for the pope, a cardinal or a patriarch.

Although battlement technology reached its peak in the first part of the 20th century, by World War II advancement in aircraft and infantry tactics rendered battlements obsolete, and they were abandoned in favor of surface-to-air missiles and antiaircraft guns.

One of the most troubling aspects of the modern criminal justice system was its inability to properly rehabilitate criminals into productive members of society.  Once prosecuted, criminals would enter correctional facilities, serve their time and return to the streets with little "correction" at all.  Most of them would become recidivists, or habitual criminals, and spend the better part of the lives in and out of the prison system.

When neural reprogramming systems found wide use in medicine in the late 21st and early 22nd centuries, law enforcement organizations urged correctional facilities to develop a system of rehabilitation that uses brain cell replacement as a means of eliminating recidivism.  The Behavioral Modification Facility sought employed neural reprogramming to great effect and dramatically reduced crime and repeat criminal activity.

The towering palace included a temple to Nabu (a god of vegetation and the patron saint of the art of writing), a royal palace, and several residences for important officials.

Later models, such as the UNIVAC (Universal Numerical Integrator and Computer) were more programmable, and, hence, more versatile, enabling users to give the computer instructions for solving more than one problem.  Companies like International Business Machines (IBM) developed large "mainframe" systems in which multiple users could share time on a single computer system.

[END]

[IMPROVE_CORRECTIONAL_FACILITY_HISTORICAL]
Before the proliferation of prison systems, the chief means of punishing serious offenders were corporal punishment, execution and banishment.  Until the late 18th century, prisons were mainly for the confinement of debtors, the accused awaiting trial and convicts awaiting sentencing.  Gradually, prisons became a more accepted method of punishment, and an emphasis on rehabilitation, reformation and correction started to emerge.  Various philosophies as to proper methods of rehabilitation abounded throughout the 19th century.  The reformatory system of late 19th century America emphasized vocational training, indeterminate sentences and rewards for good behavior and parole.  This model for the modern correctional facility prevailed in the American criminal justice system of the 20th century.

Incarceration has always been seen as an effective form of punishment.  The threat of prison acted as a deterrent to potential criminals, and the long-term removal of convicted offenders from society protected people as a whole.  Perhaps most important, the controlled environment of prison offered opportunities for reforming criminals through such things as counseling, education and vocational training.  Unfortunately, the reality of the modern correctional facility system was that often, criminals would engage in criminal activity within the confines of their prisons, and the social and economic costs of incarceration were staggeringly high.

[END]

[IMPROVE_COURTHOUSE_HISTORICAL]
The evolution of the Roman legal system was indicative of how fledgling nations developed their legal systems to accommodate ever increasing levels of complexity in laws and codes.  The earliest attempts to establish Roman law was attempted with the Twelve Tables in 451-450 BC.  They made available the rules and procedures for many civil, public, criminal and sacred laws, the minutiae of which were previously controlled and executed by a small group of pontiffs (pontifices), members of the patrician ruling class.  Posted in the Roman Forum, it became a public property and, therefore, appealable by any Roman citizen.

Roman law, and the Roman courts, primarily concerned themselves with matters of property and possessions (right over land and slaves), obligations (contracts and loans), succession (inheritance and family law) and persons (citizenship, family and slaves).  However, when Rome was first founded and insignificant to much of the Mediterranean world, laws only applied to Roman citizens.  A foreigner (perigrinus) had no rights whatsoever within Roman land, unless his state had entered into a formal agreement with Rome.  By the middle of the 3rd century BC, Rome began to grow in power.  To extend legal protections to the growing number of peregrini, the Roman Empire developed the jus gentium ("law of the nations") to govern activity between cives (citizens) and peregrini.

The rise of the role of courts in lawmaking and legal enforcement grew as the Roman legal system evolved.  The first stage of development, the legis actiones, took place during the Twelve Tables period from 5th century BC to the last 2nd century BC.  Legal procedure was divided into several steps.  Initially, the plaintiffs approached defendants in public places and requested they come to court.  Those who refused could be taken by force.  The trial consisted of a preliminary hearing, held before a magistrate, who determined whether there was a grievance and, if so, what it was.  After the issues were brought to light, both parties would agree on a iudex (judge), a prominent citizen who was not of a legal profession.  Proceedings before a iudex were less formal:  advocates spoke, presented evidence and called witnesses.  Although the iudex made a decision, he had no power to execute it.  If found in the wrong, the defendant was given a specific period in which to redress the grievance.  Failure to comply could result in the defendant being brought before the magistrate by force.  His property could be seized, or he could be made a slave to the plaintiff to work off the debt or claim.

In the later Republic period, as cases became more complex, the issues presented to the iudex had to be written down.  This lead to the formulary system, in which the procedure of defendants brought to court remained, but with a more powerful role for the magistrate in determining whether a case went to the iudex.  After the classical period ended in the late 3rd century AD, the cognitio extraordinaria system saw a further increase of power placed in the hands of magistrates and the courts.  Courts began issuing summons, trial rulings were documented and magistrates eventually supplanted iudices in the role of judge.  After Christianity became the state religion of Rome, the ecclesiastical courts, previously established by Christians who had refused to have recourse to pagan courts, became a part of the Roman legal system. As the Roman Empire disintegrated, the ecclesiastical courts survived and assumed jurisdiction over secular affairs.

[IMPROVE_DRUG_STORE_HISTORICAL]
The modern pharmacy, known colloquially as a drug store, became strikingly different from the apothecaries of the 17th and 18th centuries.  Whereas pharmacists of that era dealt in the elixirs, spirits, salves and powders outlined in the Pharmacopoeiae of London (1618) and Paris (1639), modern pharmacists dealt with complex remedies and medicines, selected for their therapeutic value and reviewed by committees of doctors and medical experts.  The Pharmacopoeia of the United States, first published in 1820, reviewed submissions by panel consisting of the U.S. Surgeon General and representatives from colleges of medicine and pharmacology, as well as state medical and pharmaceutical associations.

In 1841, the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain was founded, with intent to give pharmacists in a thoroughly scientific basis.  As pharmacology became more of a scientific pursuit, new, more powerful drugs became available.  Although physicians could only administer the most powerful drugs, pharmacists could prepare and dispense treatments both prescribed by a physician and those deemed acceptable for non-prescription use.  These "over-the-counter" drugs usually consisted of the most common treatments for the most common ailments.

As the power and speed of microprocessors increased in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, crackers were finding it easier to crack complex encryption schemes.  The gradual decline of paper and coin currencies required a new level of security for financial data.  In response, businesses and government entities sunk millions of dollars into cryptography schemes that could guarantee the security of sensitive information over the Internet, such as financial transactions, medical records and government documents.  Employing an evolving asymmetric encryption scheme, the major financial institutions began to establish electronic banks in which money could be stored with little to no risk of theft.  Customers used cards encoded with their financial information to transact business both in person and online.  Although the malicious intrusions of crackers kept system administrators busy, the new e-bank system increased the safety and efficiency of commerce.

[IMPROVE_ECO_TRANSIT_HISTORICAL]
The folly of the 20th century world's reliance on fossil fuels began to manifest itself in even greater problems than people had originally envisioned.  Many nations who had come to rely almost entirely on fossil fuels for their energy requirements were beholden to the whims of a greedy cartel of major oil-producing countries.  In light of this as well as the dwindling supply of fossil fuels worldwide, scientists scurried to develop alternate fuel sources.  Solar energy required vast stretches of uninhabited land in order to produce enough energy to supplant conventional power plants, and solar cells were highly toxic and difficult to dispose of when damaged.  The transportation and automobile industries, both major contributors to global pollution due to their reliance on internal combustion engines, were prime candidates for the development of an alternate power source.  Late 20th century experiments with battery-powered electric cars were hampered by the limited capacity of conventional batteries.  Electric car users had to recharge batteries at a rate considerably higher than conventional car users need to fill their tanks with gasoline.  Some auto manufacturers even employed electric battery-combustion engine hybrids, which reduced, but did not eliminate harmful greenhouse gas emissions.

Fuel cells, many of which derived power from the processing of non-petroleum-based organic sources, were the answer to the inefficiency of standard batteries.  Portable and reasonably inexpensive, fuel cells contained vastly more energy than rechargeable batteries and they produced little more than water as a by-product.  Now that automobiles outfitted with fuel cells could perform as well or better than conventional cars, an increasingly ecology-conscious world considered them superior vehicles.  Since pollution in cities had reached alarming heights, citizens began to clamor for clean, fuel-cell-equipped public transit systems.  As Eco-Transit spread in personal and public transportation, pollution levels the world over grew at a vastly decreased level.

[IMPROVE_FACTORY_HISTORICAL]
One of the most profound and far reaching developments brought about by the Industrial Revolutions in Western Europe over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries was the factory system.  Whereas manufactured goods were the domain of craftsmen and artisans before the Industrial Revolution, a distributed labor system, coupled with the invention of such devices as the spinning jenny and the power loom enabled a more expansive production of goods, such as textiles, with a minimum of human effort.  The American inventor Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, a device that mechanically removed cotton fibers from the seed, in 1793.  In 1801, French inventor Joseph Jacquard created a loom that employed cards with punched holes to automate the placement of threads in the weaving process.

Eli Whitney also introduced the concept of interchangeable parts to the factory system in 1798.  Because repairs and assembly could be done with previously manufactured parts rather than custom made ones, interchangeable parts made it possible to produce goods quicker and cheaper.  This idea led to the development of the assembly line and the manufacturing of products in discrete stages.  Developments in steam power and, later, the internal combustion engine freed factories up from the needs for water-sourced based power, such as mills, and led to an explosion of manufacturing power that ushered in the modern age.

The term "flak" was an abbreviated name for Fliegerabwehrkanone, the 88-millimeter German-made antiaircraft cannon that was the bane of allied bombers in World War II.  While most rapid-firing antiaircraft guns employed much smaller shells, like the 40-millimeter "Bofors guns" preferred by Allied forces against dive-bombers and low-flying aircraft.  Flak cannons, some up to 120 mm, were particularly effective against high-flying, slow-moving bombers.  The shells, fired up to 2 miles in the air at rates as high as 120 rounds a minute, used radio-waved proximity fuses that would explode within a certain range of the target.  Despite continued developments in the early 1950s, flak cannons and other heavy antiaircraft guns were eventually replaced by surface-to-air missiles in the late 1950s and early '60s.

In ancient times the granary provided cities with a means by which they could store their surplus food for shortages.  The protection from the elements that granaries provided helped minimize spoilage and waste.  The Food Silo became the modern equivalent of the granary, updated to reflect the advanced technology of the times.  Food silos took many forms, from towering grain silos to insulated warehouses that housed perishable items such as cheese or fruit.  Some food silos controlled the atmospheric gases contained within, in an attempt to extend the storage life of foods.  Others employed refrigeration and freezing to preserve the freshness, consistency and texture of highly perishable items.  All of these methods helped to minimize waste, prevent food-borne diseases and better equip cities and communities to survive occasional food shortages.

[IMPROVE_FORCEFIELD_HISTORICAL]
The rapid development of weapons and vehicle technology throughout the modern and genetic ages brought conventional warfare to dangerous new levels.  Cities were ill equipped to defend themselves against newer, more advanced assault craft.  Whereas city walls, ballista towers and battlements were suitable for 19th century combat, they often provided little more than an obstacle to a post-modern offensive army.  With the development of chaos theory and the explosion in new understanding about the nature of chaotic systems, scientists began to design theoretical models that mimicked the "forcefields" spoken of in countless science fiction books.  Not until researchers discovered the unified theory of everything did forcefield development moved from theory to reality.  Scientists developed a massive dome-shaped layer of an extremely stable form of carbon called carbon-60 "buckyballs."  When the forcefield detected high mass or energy (akin to a projectile or energy beam weapon) it solidified, linking carbon to carbon in a solid shield with the hardness and resiliency of pure diamond.  The first cities to employ this technology were able to withstand substantial attacks from hover infantry, tanks and cruise missiles.  Finally, city defense technology had risen to the level of offensive warfare technology.

In 1998, construction on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, began.  It was designed to generate 1.5 billion watts of fusion power continuously.  The $10 billion experiment, a partnership between the European Union, Japan, Russia and the United States, was declared a success in 2009.  Although it provided substantial insight into fusion technology, commercial fusion reactors did not become a reality until late in the 21st century.  Advances in nano-assembly, chaos theory and high temperature superconductors made safe, effective fusion reactors possible.

Fusion became the most environmentally clean power source the world had known.  It generated no pollutants, greenhouse gases and a fraction of the radioactivity that fission-reaction nuclear power plants did.  Fusion reactors were much safer, with no serious threat from control system failures.  Unlike a fission reactor, which could catastrophically meltdown in the case of a systems failure, fusion reactors merely cooled off - the plasma cooled and reactions ceased.  The abundance of deuterium in the world's oceans combined with the ability to breed tritium within the reactor itself meant that fusion reactors were a virtually inexhaustible supply of energy.

Although the earliest agriculturalist civilizations existed in the Indus River valley around the 8th millennium BC, it wasn't until the 6th millennium BC that the developed pottery techniques sufficient to enable the construction of storage devices.  At Merhgarh near the Indo-Iranian border, some of the first granaries were built.  They consisted of holes dug into the ground and covered by stone or clay bricks.  They often contained compartments, as well as pots and urns used to store food surpluses.  They were a crucial step in enabling people to settle land and expand their civilizations.  With proper food storage techniques, societies could cope with the unpredictability of weather, soil and natural forces.

In the 1850s and 60s, hospitals were overcrowded, poorly ventilated, inadequately cleaned places.  Hospital care was considerably more dangerous to peoples' health than home care, and as many as 25 percent of patients died after surgery due to poor sanitation.  However, in 1865, British surgeon Joseph Lister introduced sanitation techniques that vastly increased the safety of hospitalization.  The care of the patient improved with the introduction of formal nurses training schools.  The first U.S. nursing schools were founded independently in 1873 by New York's Bellevue Hospital, Boston's General Hospital and the New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.  The development of X rays and the clinical laboratory in the 1890s further improved the quality of care available to patients and prompted the opening of many new hospitals, including religious hospitals and hospitals that specialized in the treatment of women or children. The number of for-profit hospitals owned by doctors also increased between 1890 and 1920.

[END]

[IMPROVE_MOVIE_PALACE_HISTORICAL]
The lavish motion picture palaces of the early 20th century, which later spawned the massive, multi-screen movie theaters of the late 20th century were themselves borne of the live theaters and music halls of fin de siècle urban America.  The earliest films were not originally shown in movie palaces.  Rather, they were shown on Kinetoscope machines that permitted only one viewer at a time.  Existing entertainment venues, such as penny arcades, installed rows of these machines and enticed patrons to view these new technological creations.  Because Kinetoscopes were little more than optical illusions, people tended to regard them as curiosities.  The earliest films were marketed based not on stars, titles or subjects but the projection machinery involved.  Tally's Electric Theater, the first building devoted entirely to movies, was built in Los Angeles in 1902.  Even though the mass relocation of East Coast filmmakers that birthed the Hollywood movie industry had yet to happen until the end of the decade, movies were popular enough to urge businessmen to invest in storefront theaters and "nickelodeons."  These new theaters employed new projection technology that, unlike the Kinetoscopes, enabled multiple patrons to view a film projected on a screen.  Nickelodeons garnered a sordid reputation and rankled upper class citizens, who preferred the "respectable" theaters that showed operas, plays and vaudeville.

Films began to catch the attention of upper class audiences when "big-time" vaudeville operators began including them on the bill.  When Adolph Zukor showed the film Queen Elizabeth at the Lyceum Theater in New York in 1912, audiences enjoyed the dramatic, stage-like presentation of the subject matter, and, particularly, the appearance of Sarah Bernhardt, a noted stage actor, in the title role.  Filmmakers began to produce movies consisting of little more than filmed productions of staged theater in an attempt to improve the industry's image.  The first feature length films, including D.W. Griffith's twelve-reel Birth of a Nation in 1915, transformed movies into narrative vehicles, rather than mere technological curiosities.  

The vaudeville houses of the same period fused highbrow and popular cultural influences in their architecture and decor.  Patrons entered though lavish, often oriental-themed facades festooned with flashing lights and marquees into marble-floored, mirrored-wall foyers, decked out with oil paintings, plush furniture and smartly dressed personal attendants.  They attempted to mimic the grandeur of New York's opera houses, and offered extra amenities.  Proctor's Pleasure Palace, built in 1895, offered a roof garden restaurant, library, barbershop, and a Turkish bath housed in a Romanesque facade.  As films gained prominence and legitimacy, movie palaces sought to provide the same experience as the best vaudeville houses.  The Regent, American's first motion picture palace, opened in New York in 1913.  Although it was located in a working class district, uptown from the legitimate theater district, its opening night audience consisted of many of the same patrons of New York's toniest opera houses and theaters.  Movie palaces, such as the Strand, the Rialto and the Rivoli, soon took their place along legitimate theaters on Broadway.

Samuel L. Rothapfel, also known as "Roxy," was, more than anyone else, responsible for the increasing opulence of these movie houses.  He presided over the openings of many movie palaces, and instituted practices distinct from traditional theaters, namely, unreserved seating and low admission prices.  What perhaps contributed to the success and allure of movie palaces was that they were designed to make the average citizen feel like royalty.  Movie palaces gave people an opportunity to step into a world of fantasy and, for the pioneers of the movie industry, many of whom were first generation Americans, this was the fulfillment of the American dream.

Before scientists were able to build functional nano-machines, they discovered a way to assemble simple items at the molecular level.  Nanite factories sprang up in cities, enabling manufacturers to construct objects out of minerals such as gold, carbon and titanium, as well as organic materials such as wood.  Complex objects, such as electrical appliances, could be constructed as well.  Later applications of nano-assembly allowed for the manufacture of objects of unorthodox construction, such as sheets of flawless diamond.  Nanite construction and nano-assembly revolutionized the manufacturing industry, rendering robotic plants obsolete.

[IMPROVE_NUCLEAR_PLANT_HISTORICAL]
In 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann discovered nuclear fission.  By bombarding uranium with neutrons in an attempt to create elements heavier than uranium, they unwittingly induced a fission reaction.  When a particle such as a neuron hit the nucleus of a uranium atom, it caused it to split into two fission fragments of roughly the same atomic composition.  This process released a large amount of thermal energy, as well as gamma rays and a few free neutrons, which in turn fissioned other uranium nuclei.  This series of fissions constituted a chain reaction, which yielded a constant supply of nuclear energy.  If these reactions could be controlled, scientists theorized, then one would have a supply of energy much cleaner than conventional oil, gas and coal-burning power plants.  In the late 1950s an early '60s, a few commercial nuclear power plants were built.  The most successful of these used water as a cooling system for reactors.  The demand for nuclear plants skyrocketed in the mid-1960s and early '70s but dropped off in the later part of the decade, due to a decline in need, coupled with public fears about the danger of nuclear meltdown.

In a nuclear reactor, the chain reaction produced a tremendous amount of radiation and thermal energy.  Some of the thermal energy was used to heat water and create steam.  The steam drove a turbine, and the turbine's mechanical energy was converted to energy by means of a generator.  Despite the relative cleanliness of nuclear power, nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1979 and at Chernobyl, Soviet Union in 1986 became iconic reminders of the catastrophic power of uncontrolled fission reactions.  Despite these incidents, nuclear plants continued to operate in Europe, Japan and various other countries for many years.

As the advancement of science in the 21st century continued to gain momentum, researchers began to bump up against the limitations of the world - atmospheric conditions, environmental regulations and the omnipresence of gravity.  Seeking a research facility in which they could conduct experiments with no regard for these considerations, scientists looked to the stars.  In 2037, a privately funded research group headed by the noted physicist Richard Myers launched the first operational orbital laboratory into space.  The small research team aboard the craft was now able to conduct experiments in pursuit of breakthroughs in chaos theory and unified field theory.  The laboratory was expensive to build and maintain.  An advanced composite structure kept it lightweight and free from degradation.  Fuel cells powered the huge reactors and battery of diagnostic equipment at the scientists' disposal.  Soon, several cities began launching their own satellites and prompting a worldwide boost in scientific research.

[END]

[IMPROVE_PUBLIC_TRANSPORTATION_HISTORICAL]
The first modern public transportation systems date back to 16th and 17th century Europe, where horse-drawn carriages offered for-hire transportation between major towns.  Carriage systems existed in large cities as well, eventually replaced in the 19th century by stagecoaches and, later, omnibuses.  In 1832, New York City introduced horse-drawn streetcars that ran on iron rails rather than wagon wheels.  Rails reduced friction, making it easier for horses to pull the rail cars.  By the 1860s, most U.S. cities had horse- or mule-powered street franchised by the city.  Andrew Hallidie invented the cable car, of which the first successful system was opened in San Francisco in 1873.  Its propulsion system relied on cables running the length of the tracks rather than waste-producing, disease-prone horses.  More than 30 cities employed similar systems, which were later replaced by electric streetcar systems.

In 1888, electric power revolutionized urban public transportation with the completion of the first electrified streetcar line in Richmond, Virginia.  Subway systems were also popular with London, England, Boston, Massachusetts and New York City all opening electric subways systems around the turn of the century.  Modern cities the world over employed a combination of subways, light rail and bus systems to shuttle large groups of people around quickly and cheaply.  Public transit systems were more prevalent in older cities, because these cities established public transportation well before automobile use was common.  Population density played a role as well.  Higher density cities needed public transportation more, especially one with major business districts.

Well-implemented public transit produced enormous benefits for communities:  improved air-quality, less land consumption, lower energy requirements and lower accident costs.  Because many people are carried in the same vehicle, transportation takes up less space and energy than automobile-based systems.  Busses, which are the backbone of many city transit systems, have lower accident rates than autos, mainly due to their operation by professional drivers.  Subway and light rail systems are safer and more cost-effective by far than autos or buses.

[IMPROVE_PUBLISHING_HOUSE_HISTORICAL]
Before the invention of writing, most likely by the Sumerians in the fourth millennium BC, people could only spread information by word of mouth.  Writing was originally considered a way of recording socially and economically vital information, such as genealogical tables, codes of law and religious texts, rather than a vehicle for information dissemination.  Because writing was seen as an act of recording, not distributing, information in ancient times, only nontheocratic societies, such as Rome and China, had any semblance of publishing beyond letters and scripts, that is, a copying industry for the purpose of supplying a non-religious readership.

With the invention of printing in 6th century AD China, and later improvements in moveable type in the 11th century, the written word, and its possibilities, evolved.  Johannes Gutenberg's printing press brought Europe into the fold of modern printing techniques in the mid-15th century.  Although one of the chief uses of printing was rapid and inexpensive publishing of religious materials, publishing found its uses in the academic world as well, and, in fact, was one of the critical developments that brought Europe out of the Dark Ages and into the Renaissance.  It contributed to a steady rise in literacy for the middle class and the expanded intellectual pursuits for the next 500 years.  The publishing industry was slow to grow, but demand for mass-produced, secular texts in philosophy, science and politics increased.  Freedom of the press was, for the most part, established in Europe and North America by the 18th century as most attempts to regulate this mode of communication by forces that deemed it dangerous had been defeated.  More than anything else, the prevalence of both publicly- and privately-owned publishing houses freed the written word from its mostly religious role and contributed to an explosion of education, literacy and intellectual development.

[END]

[IMPROVE_RECYCLING_PLANT_HISTORICAL]
Although waste had always been a problem in human societies, the population growth of the 20th century compounded this problem enormously. To meet this challenge, governments and private organizations began programs to reduce the flow of waste products into landfills and incinerators by paying citizens a nominal amount of money to recycle products such as glass, plastic, or aluminum.  Cities and municipalities opened recycling centers to facilitate collection, the product of which went to recycling plants.  A culture of reusability pervaded many industries, and recyclable materials eventually included iron and steel scrap, aluminum, glass, paper, wood and plastics. 

Contrary to prevailing belief at the time, recycling took hold in modern, affluent societies not because it was an environmentally responsible thing to do, but because it was economically advantageous for large-scale manufacturing operations.  The cost of recycling certain materials was less than the cost of processing new raw materials.  Nevertheless, widespread recycling efforts diminished human impact on the ecology in three distinct ways: it reduced manufacturers' needs for finite natural resources, such as petroleum, trees, mineral ores, and coal, it helped reduce the volume of solid waste in landfills, which had become increasingly expensive, and it reduced the pollution of air, water and land resulting from waste disposal.

[IMPROVE_ANTI_BALLISTIC_MISSILES_HISTORICAL]
Although late 20th-century politicians and military theorists envisioned a large-scale satellite-driven early warning and defensive engagement system for the prevention of nuclear ballistic missile attacks, such systems failed to gain widespread support from the public.  In addition, technical problems, cost prohibitions and an increasingly hostile diplomatic climate forced many of these visionaries to shelve their dreams.  Scientists instead opted for a distributed system, devoid of central control, that could enable a nation to concentrate anti-ballistic missile defenses around strategic cities and other sites, such as ICBM silos.  The system employed both satellite- and ground-based beam weapon systems to intercept incoming missiles in combination with sophisticated electronic countermeasures designed to scramble missile targeting systems.  Radar, optical and infrared detection systems formed the front line of defense and remotely coordinated the interception systems.

Public officials and social critics argued vehemently against such defense systems.  However, the decline in control over the distribution of nuclear weapons technology raised the specter nuclear missile attacks not from established nations like the Soviet Union, the United States or India but from extremists and terrorists.  Public opinion in favor of anti-ballistic missile systems eventually prevailed, and many cities began to adopt the defensive technology to protect themselves against an increasingly hostile and unpredictable world.

[IMPROVE_SECURITY_MONITOR_HISTORICAL]
Advancements in video technology, computer systems and artificial intelligence proliferated in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  The prevalence of private security systems in homes, businesses and institutions was not a new phenomenon.  However, in response to an increasingly strident public outcry at rising crime rates, many cities began to install security systems in public places.  These new systems employed sophisticated AI protocols to monitor activity and process any abnormalities.  At first, law enforcement efforts found the new AI surveillance systems a boon to their operations.  Crime rates dropped, due to enhanced criminal identification and apprehension efforts.

Some law enforcement advocates began to speculate on the potential uses for AI surveillance in private areas as well.  They pointed to their successes on the streets as proof of the system's worth and pressed law-makers to relax privacy laws in order to enable building owners to install surveillance systems in their buildings to monitor tenants.  What had become a positive solution to the problem of public-area crime became a nightmarish violation of privacy, as government and law enforcement now had the power to monitor people in their own homes.  The same public that demanded surveillance systems on the streets now found cameras in their homes.  Crime continued to drop, as people no longer had a place to hide their illicit activities.  However, the constant invasion of privacy, once a right guaranteed by many civilized nations, had created an embittered and outraged public.

These advancements later became the basis of the modern television.  In 1932, the Radio Corporation of America employed a camera tube called an iconoscope and a cathode-ray tube in the receiver of one of the first all-electronic televisions.  By the 1950s, there were separate color and black-and-white signals broadcast.  Televisions became a standard fixture in the living rooms of America, supplanting radio as the dominant source of entertainment.

The word "theater" derived from the Greek word "theaomai," meaning "to see."

Seating for spectators formed a semi-circle around the orchestra.  It was usually cut into a hillside and featured wooden benches, and, later, stone or marble seats.  The steep layout of some auditoriums enabled as much as 10,000 to 20,000 people to sit reasonably close to the action on stage, as well as enhanced acoustics.  Some theaters employed periaktoi, or revolving panels, to quickly change scenery, as well as a mechane, or crane, which served to fly in the gods (deus ex machina) to provide closure at the end of a tragic play.

In the 1980s, however, media experts began to speculate on the death of TV and movies at the hands of an emerging technological medium with far-reaching entertainment potential, called "virtual reality."  This technology faded from public consciousness in lieu of any compelling applications, however, and TV and movies continued to claim the majority share of the public's entertainment quotient.  Amusement parks began to incorporate more technology in their attractions, combining the power of moving traditional animatronics and detailed environments with moving pictures, compelling sound, pyrotechnics and dynamic lighting.  However, these attractions could only produce so much verisimilitude.  The limited interactivity of traditional attraction technology mitigated their depth of immersion.  Thrill rides could only follow one path, live action sequences were often scripted and safety considerations limited the possible actions guests could take within environments.

The explosion in computer hardware technology in the late 1990s and early 2000s refocused attention of creating a virtual reality environment, in which patrons could exist and interact in a realistic physical space.  However, developments in neural interfaces shifted the focus of virtual reality and immersion entertainment from highly detailed physical environments to ultra-realistic "mental" environments.  The first neural interface VR machines employed high-resolution liquid crystal display eyepieces, standard headphones and an array of electrodes on the subject's scalp.  The eyepieces broadcast images, synchronized with sounds, and the electrodes monitored brain activity to trigger environmental elements and "read" the subject's impulses, translating them into actions within the environment.  As neural interfaces evolved, virtual reality devices simply tapped into the nervous system itself.  Instead of displaying images to the ocular receptors of the eye, they piped data, translated into neurochemical impulses into the part of the brain that interpreted visual data.  The same theory applied to aural stimuli as well.  To complete the circle of interactivity, the neural interface monitored sectors of the brain, including emotions, motor skills and thought processes, to gauge the user's actions within the synthesized environment.

The first Virtual Reality "Amusement Park" opened in Berlin in 2027.  Guests donned neural interfaces and sat comfortably in anechoic chambers, transporting their consciousness to another reality.  VR Amusement Parks began to supplant more traditional entertainment media, leading motion picture and television studios to switch to producing VR Sims instead of traditional films.  Citizens, once delighted and mesmerized by movie screens soon found the superior experience in being a part of the movie itself.  The worlds of cinema, theme parks and computer games had intersected, revolutionizing entertainment forever.

The origins of the modern aircraft carrier date back to 1910, when an American civilian pilot, Eugene Ely, flew a plane off a specially built platform attached to the deck of the U.S. cruiser Birmingham at Hampton Roads, Virginia.  Ely then performed the first carrier landing, on the quarterdeck of the battleship Pennsylvania, in San Francisco, California on January 18, 1911.  By using wires attached to sandbags, he was able to stop his plane quickly.  The British, Japanese and U.S. navies began to develop the first true carriers with unobstructed flight decks but the war ended before they could see battle.  The aircraft carrier came of age in World War II as they began to prove themselves more versatile, effective and destructive than battleships and battle cruisers for naval combat.

In the beginning of World War II, planes dive-bombing and torpedo bombing from carriers did not have enough velocity or destructive power to penetrate battleship armor.  By the end of the war, advances in aircraft and weapons technology finally gave carrier-based planes the power they needed to sink even the largest Yamato-class battleships of the Japanese fleet.  The long reign of the battleship ended when U.S. carrier-based planes sunk the Musashi in October 1944 and the Yamato in 1945.  Carriers continued to be the most formidable ship in the world for well into the 21st century.

Though no single civilization can lay claim to its invention, origins of archery can be traced back at least 40,000 years.  The earliest bows consisted of a thin length of wood fastened with string or sinew at each end.  Later, bows were made of several materials, including wood and horn glued together and reinforced with bands of sinew.  The English longbow, made of wood from the yew tree, was famous in battle, helping win battles over the French at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt during the Hundred Years' War.  Other cultures employed the bow in war, hunting and recreational archery, including the Egyptians, Assyrians, Chinese, Goths and Mongols.  Accounts of Renaissance-era European travelers indicate that the bow and arrow was the weapon of choice on virtually every continent.

Artillery was a fearsome development in the early 20th century battlefield.  Artillery guns replaced cannons as the preferred heavy weapon that shot explosive shells over considerable distances.  Over the first decades of the 20th century, artillery evolved as a devastatingly effective anti-personnel weapon.  In the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, artillery accounted for ten percent of casualties.  By World War I, that number rose to seventy percent.  It was not a flawless weapon, however.  It was relatively easy to fortify buildings and installations to sufficiently defend against artillery fire.

[UNIT_BATTLESHIP_HISTORICAL]
The high seas of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the setting for the swift advance of naval tactics and warfare.  Navies abandoned the wooden-hulls and sails of ships-of-the-line in favor of engine powered, metal-hulled battleships and cruisers. Combining large size, powerful guns, and heavy armor with speed, strength and range, battleships were the unrivaled capital ships of the world's navies for nearly a century after they were first introduced in 1860.  

World War II was the battleship's heyday, when the Washington Treaty of 1922, which limited battleship sizes to 35,000 tons of displacement, was abandoned.  The United States, Germany and Japan built 45,000-ton Iowa class, 52,600-ton Bismarck class and 72,000-ton Yamato class battleships, respectively.  They employed antiaircraft weapons, 5-inch caliber rapid-fire guns and a multitude of 20 to 40 mm automatic weapons.  They could travel great distances at the relatively high speed of over 30 knots.  This period of dominance came to a swift end, however, with the rapid development of the aircraft carrier, the range and striking power of which relegated the battleship to coastal bombardment and carrier escort duties.  The United States continued to employ World War II-era battleships in the latter 20th century, finally retiring the Wisconsin and the Missouri, the two remaining Iowa-class ships, after service in the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s.

As gunpowder revolutionized the world of infantry and melee combat in the 16th century, it revolutionized siege weapons in the mid 1300s.  Although the earliest "bombards" were unwieldy, unreliable and relatively weak siege weapons, improvements in metallurgy in the next two centuries dramatically increased the quality of smelted iron and bronze.  By the beginning of the 16th century, iron cannon, cast in blast furnaces, began to improve.  Cannons accompanied by infantry and cavalry replaced catapults, pikemen and knights on the battlefields of Europe and Asia.  Ships also capitalized on the emerging cannon technology to intensify naval combat.

[UNIT_CARAVAN_HISTORICAL]
In ancient times, merchants, pilgrims and travelers often journeyed together in deserts and hostile regions for mutual protection.  In the deserts of northern Africa and Asia, camels were the most common animal used in caravans, due to its broad appetite, its ability to go without water for several days and its load capacity.  Although camels were harnessed to carts in the tea trade between China and Mongolia, they often carried their loads split in two equal parts and fastened to their backs.  In hot weather or on long journeys, camels typically carried 350 pounds.  On shorter journeys, in cooler climes and in order to evade customs duties, camels often carried as much as 1,000 pounds.

Caravan sizes varied depending on the amount of traffic on the route, the relative safety of the route and the availability of camels.  The largest caravans ever recorded were for special purposes, such as Muslim pilgrimages to Mecca that included over 10,000 camels, or the salt caravans that traversed the Sahara from Taodenni to Timbuktu, which numbered 20,000 camels.  Camels were fastened together with rope passed through nose rings and tied to the saddle, in lines of up to 40 camels.  As many as four strings would travel abreast or the whole caravan traveled in a single-file line.

The timelines of caravan operations depended on the availability of water and food, as well as seasonal considerations.  The Orenburg caravan left Bukhara after the winter snows of Russia melted, and the Basra caravan left Alepo after the rains of late autumn in the Middle East.  A caravan averaged 2 to 3 miles per hour for up to 14 hours a day.  Some locations along well-traveled routes had caravansaries, which had stables and rooms for rest.

Eventually, the increase in sea trade contributed to the decline of many of the major routes (such as the Silk Road from China to the Mediterranean).  Many caravans continued to operate until the 19th century, when rail transport and the abolition of the slave trade spelled the end for the centuries-old form of transport and travel.

[UNIT_CARRACK_HISTORICAL]
One of the most popular and versatile ships of late 15th and early 16th century Europe, the carrack was ideal for both trade and warfare.  
Initially designed as a two-mast ship, shipbuilders eventually added a third mast to accommodate more sails.  This enabled the carrack to meet the load and speed requirements that the increasing scale, frequency and range of international trade demanded.  As designers added multiple masts, they also elongated the hull; keels were often two and a half times as long as the ship's beam (width).  The hull, which consisted of large, caulked planks laid end to end against a frame, distinguished the carrack from clinker-style ships with hulls of overlapping planks.  Weighing between 700 to 1000 tons, Carracks were two to three times heavier than their early 15th-century predecessors.

Carracks' high sides made them easily defensible. They could be adapted to carry troops or horses, and they could withstand attacks well. 
Two of the most famous Carracks were the Santa Maria, one of Christopher Columbus' legendary fleet of ships, and the Mary Rose.  Built in 1510 at the order of King Henry VIII of England, the 105-foot battle carrack carried cannons fired out of gun ports cut into the sides of the ship.  However, gun ports were a vulnerability for the Mary Rose and similarly designed carracks.  When the ship listed to the side, water could pour in and sink it.  Historians speculate that the Mary Rose, which sank in 1545, most likely met this fate.  Regardless of this, the carrack served both trade functions and war duties admirably.

[UNIT_CATAPULT_HISTORICAL]
The catapult was the one of the most effective siege weapons used in ancient and medieval warfare.  Although many siege weapons, including ballistae, magonels and trebuchets, fall under the general heading catapult, the term almost always refers to a mounted, single long arm of wood that hurled stones and other objects.  They operated by a sudden release of tension on wooden beams or twisted cords of fibers, usually, gut, sinew or horsehair.  Their primary use was attacking fortresses or cities.  By hurling large rocks, flaming balls or groups of small stones, catapults could severely damage walls, ignite fires and devastate closely ranked foot soldiers and cavalry.  Some catapults were permanently mounted in fortresses and used for defense, while others were set on a wheeled cart for easy transport and positional change.  The introduction of the gunpowder cannon in the 14th century spelled the end of the catapult's use in warfare.

[UNIT_CLERIC_HISTORICAL]
The cleric was a kind of religious crusader that flourished during the middle ages.  Many types of clergy, such as monks, friars and priests, often led a life of itinerant austerity, traveling from town to town, preaching in exchange for charitable contributions and shelter.  Though these men were often solitary crusaders, orders of clergy began taking it upon themselves to spread their teachings across the land.  In 1214, Saint Dominic, along with 16 of his disciples, founded the Roman Catholic religious order known as the Dominicans at Toulouse, France for the purpose of combating the heresies of the time with preaching and teaching.  In 1216, Pope Honorius III granted the Dominicans papal confirmation, and granted them special privileges, including the right to preach and hear confessions anywhere without obtaining local authorization.  Dominicans were unflaggingly devoted to the evangelization of the heretical and uneducated.  During the crusades, a series of military invasions organized by Western Christians against Muslim powers, clerics often accompanied soldiers to help maintain their morale.  They also took the opportunity to teach, preach to and convert non-Christians.

Multinational corporations often kept their main executive offices within their home country, opting to send their manufacturing and production operations to countries with cheaper labor pools.  They could hire workers for a fraction of the cost of domestic workers, getting better return on their investment in factories and manufacturing plants.  Corporate branches also established themselves as commercial entities in foreign markets, selling their products abroad.

Using the same technology developed for constructing deep-water undersea colonies and deep-sea mining operations, military scientists developed a craft that could transport armed forces through the benthos.    Because it skims the ocean surface, keeping an extremely low sonar and radar signature, it earned the nickname "crawler."  Although it saw limited civilian use, the crawler became the transport unit of choice for stealth operations because it lacked the vulnerability of air, land and ocean-surface transport.  Its ability to invade underwater cities also made it indispensable for undersea raids.

[UNIT_DESTROYER_HISTORICAL]
In the 1890s, the term destroyer referred to 250-ton vessels deployed to protect battleships from torpedo boats.  By World War I, torpedo-boat destroyers became advanced torpedo boats themselves, and were often deployed ahead of battle fleets to scout for the enemy fleet, attack the destroyers with cannon fire and then launch torpedoes against battleships and cruisers.  When submarines became the main torpedo-launching vessel, shipbuilders outfitted destroyers with hydrophones and depth charges to protect battle fleets and merchant-ship convoys against this new tactic.  By World War II, however, the invention of radar and antiaircraft guns added the role of air defense to this already formidable escort ship.

After World War II, the destroyer's dual role of antiaircraft and antisubmarine became even more powerful with the advent of guided missiles.  Modern destroyers commonly carried surface-to-air missiles, antisubmarine torpedoes, anti-ship missiles and 4 to 5 inch caliber guns.  Some carried small helicopters to aid in sub-hunting, and a few carried cruise missiles.  With a crew of 300, speed capability of 30 knots and a displacement of from 4,000 to 7,000 tons, destroyers were one of the best naval attack craft of the modern age.

[UNIT_DIPLOMAT_HISTORICAL]
Among the ruins of eastern Mediterranean civilizations lay the roots of diplomacy.  Records detailing treaties between Mesopotamian city-states date from 2850 BC.  The first diplomatic language was Akkadian (Babylonian), serving as an international tongue until Aramaic replaced it.  Archaeologists discovered cuneiform tablets from the 14th century BC documenting a diplomatic correspondence, in Akkadian, between the Egyptian court and a Hittite king.  The full texts of treaties between Ramses II of Egypt and Hittite leaders existed as well.  China had leagues, missions and a system of diplomatic correspondence as early as the 8th century BC, and evidence of sophisticated Indian diplomacy in the 4th century BC implies it developed even earlier.  The Greek system of diplomacy, however, became the model for international diplomacy in much of the West for centuries.

Greek heralds were the first diplomats, protected by the gods with immunity from harm.  Hermes, messenger of the gods and patron god of heralds, was associated with the institution of diplomacy.  Although, as the herald of Zeus, he gained a reputation for being persuasive and eloquent, he was also known as a dishonest knave, a stigma that became associated with diplomats well into modern times.  Heralds were recognized internationally as unassailable, meaning that, even in foreign lands, they were almost never assaulted, imprisoned or otherwise harmed.  To signify their inviolable status, heralds and messengers often carried an emblem, such as a message stick, and were received by their hosts with great ceremony.  Because of this, heralds were often used as contacts between nations at war.  They often preceded small groups of envoys to arrange safe passage.  Envoys, traveling in groups to ensure loyalty, were politically prominent orators dispatched to sway foreign assemblies and leaders.

The Greeks established many diplomatic conventions, including principles of international conduct, diplomatic vocabulary, and international law that survived well into the modern age.  Greek diplomats negotiated truces, treaties, alliances and neutrality, and held conventions, conferences and receptions.  They laid the foundation for a multilateral diplomacy system that evolved and transformed over the next two millennia.

The Dreadnaught was the most ingeniously designed military vehicle in history.  One of the first watercraft to make use of smart materials, its exterior was comprised of a voluntarily elastic substance that enabled the dreadnaught to propel itself through water by mimicking the undulations of a sea creature.  It could harden into a nearly impenetrable carapace of armor or languidly morph around a natural rock formation.  It is capable of dramatic, chameleon-like camouflage techniques.  When near the surface of the ocean, the dreadnaught's exterior would sense the light and selectively reflect only a fraction of the visible spectrum, making it barely visible to passing craft.  Its arsenal included plasma weaponry and conventional torpedoes.  The dreadnaught was unquestionably the zenith of military technology and the most feared ship in the world.

Developed out of the Gaia Theory experiments of the Eden Project, the Eco-Ranger's roots lied in the application of nanotechnology to pollution elimination and control.  The Eden Project sought to develop a nanite that ferreted out polluting elements and eliminated them.  Once the technology was successfully applied, however, a faction of Ecotopian scientists involved in the Eden Project took the application a step further, designing nanites to annihilate any trace of humanity.  By seeking out any manmade entity, be it a synthetic material, non-natural chemical or polluting agent, the Eco-Ranger erased any trace of humanity on the land.  Entire cities simply disappeared, their inhabitants, buildings replaced by pristine wilderness.  This weapon eclipsed any other nuclear, biotech or nanotech weapon to come before it.  Although the Eden Project started out in the interest of addressing global pollution, its designers scarcely envisioned that their noble intentions would beget the destructive power of the Eco-Ranger.

The Ecotopian philosophy of radical environmentalism, comprised of a way of life that was most in harmony with nature, emerged as a full-fledged political movement in the early 22nd century.  The Ecotopians sought not only to repair the damage wrought by centuries of unchecked progress but also to design a system of living that guaranteed the health of the planet by minimizing the human impact on ecologies.  Ecotopians advocated the elimination, by any means available, of any systems that generated pollution.  The Ecotopian Elite Guard was established in the mid 22nd century as a special wing of the Ecotopian National Guard.  The Elite Guard, known by other nations as "Eco-Terrorists," raided cities, detonating nanite bombs designed to take out antiquated fossil-fuel-burning power plants.  Though their methods were controversial, they won many passionate adherents within Ecotopian nations.  The Ecotopians invested heavily into military applications of nanites, and their reliance on stealth and mass destruction earned them few allies in the world community.

[UNIT_EMPATHIC_DIPLOMAT_HISTORICAL]
As geneticists began to delve into the vast world of gene therapy and its many applications, they originally sought to eliminate the genetic roots of disease and deformity in humans.  In the process of searching for the genetic roots of Alzheimer's disease, geneticists discovered a way to increase the general use of brains.  It was common knowledge that, at any given time, a human being only used between 10 and 30 percent of their brain for even the most intensive tasks.  They engineered a gene that enabled a two-fold increase in brain use, which vastly increased specific capacities of certain parts of the brain.  Unfortunately, they were unable to pinpoint and target a particular capacity or aptitude.  Rather, children implanted with this gene would develop an unpredictable, but usually beneficial, new aptitude.  Some grew to be towering intellects, master artisans and amazingly talented artists.  A handful of people developed superbly heightened emotional capacities.  These "empaths," as they were called, found a place in the business and governmental realms as masters of conflict resolution and diplomacy.  Endowed with the abilities to sense the emotional states of those they encountered, they were uniquely gifted in the art of negotiations, mediation and ambassadorship.

[END]

[UNIT_FASCIST_HISTORICAL]
The Fascist governments of Italy, Germany and Spain in the mid-20th century were distinguished by their zealous adherence to militaristic, authoritarian ideals.  Fascist leaders, such as Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler and Francisco Franco, relied on strong military and state police forces to enforce order, seize and maintain power, root out dissidents and fulfill on their expansionist foreign policies.  Whether state police, special forces or standard military, fascist soldiers exhibited a fanatical devotion to their role in the state.  The de facto police state that proliferated in the three major European fascist states afforded the military and police huge powers over the lives of citizens.  Fascists gained a reputation for violent, determined military action and a fanatical allegiance to their leaders.

Mussolini organized the Camicie Nere, or Blackshirts, to help him seize power and destroy the political and economic organizations of the Socialists in 1920.  They attacked hundreds of Socialists, Communists, republicans and other non-fascist political organizations, murdering hundreds of people.  On February 1, 1923, Mussolini transformed the Blackshirts into a national militia, the Voluntary Fascist Militia for National Security.  They continued to act as the military and police arm of the Italian fascist state until Mussolini's assassination in 1945.

In April 1925, Adolf Hitler established the Schutzstaffel (German, "Protective Echelon") as a small personal bodyguard force.  A black-uniformed elite corps of the Nazi party, the SS rose to power along with Hitler, garnering tremendous police and military powers.  He also created a paramilitary organization known as the Sturmabteilung (German "Assault Division").  Known by several names - Brownshirts, Storm Troopers, the SA - their violent methods of intimidation played a vital role in Hitler's rise to power.  Perhaps most famous of the fascist military forces, the Gestapo (short for Geheime Staatspolizei, or "Secret State Police") were the political police of Nazi Germany responsible for the elimination of opposition forces and dissidents within Germany.  The ruthless, atavistic force with which the Gestapo operated was one of the most diabolical aspects of the Nazi apparatus.

The fighter airplane, which was primarily designed to destroy other aircraft in combat, was introduced in the first World War, but did not played a key role until World War II.  They were often the highest performing aircraft of their times, capable of outflying and outmaneuvering opposing fighters.  They were armed with weapons specially designed to hit enemy aircraft, such as rapid-fire machine guns.

During World War II, all-metal, propeller-engine fighters were capable of speeds of 450 miles and reached ceilings of 35,000 to 40,000 feet.  Some of the more notable fighters from that period were the British Spitfire and Hurricane, the U.S. P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang, the German Focke Wulf FW-190 and the Japanese Zero.  Uses of fighters included air support for naval sorties, reconnaissance, light bombing runs, dogfighting, harassment and support for ground attacks.

The fire trireme was one of the most destructive ships that ever sailed the Mediterranean.

The Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus burned down a Pisan fleet in the eleventh century with ships equipped with this volatile concoction that ignited upon impact with water.  He ordered each of his ships set with a lion's head made of iron or bronze. Tubes fed through the lions' mouths into containers of Greek fire, giving the lions the appearance of spewing magnificent breaths of fire on the wooden ships of their enemies.

[UNIT_Z_FREIGHT_TRANSPORT_HISTORICAL]
As the global economy began to explode in size in the late 20th century, there emerged a tremendous need for new systems of delivery of raw materials and trade goods.  Most of the existing transit systems, rail, shipping and trucking already handled cargo as a primary duty.  These disparate systems began to integrate into global shipping operations in order to meet the demands of the international economy.  Although many large corporations employed their own private shipping operations, several shipping conglomerates emerged to facilitate most of the international freight transport in the modern era.  

A standard container size made shipping easier.  A single 8 ft x 8 ft by 20 ft container could fit on a truck trailer, two of them could fit on a rail car and several thousand could fit in huge container ships.  They made loading easier by requiring only one kind of crane to load and unload ships.  Many of the world's largest cities expanded their ports to accommodate these behemoth watercraft.  Other bulk cargo, such as oil, required specially designed ships to transport.

[END]

[UNIT_FRIGATE_HISTORICAL]
The PT boat was a high-speed attack boat primarily used by the United States Navy in the early to mid-20th century.  It was armed with two to four torpedoes, several depth charges and 20-mm and 40-mm guns.  Typically crewed by 14 soldiers, they averaged about 80 feet in length and could travel up to 40 knots.  They were fast, maneuverable, and very effective at night missions.

The Patrol Torpedo (PT) Boat evolved out of the American Civil War era practice of deploying ordinary boats to plant explosives on enemy ships at anchor under the cover of darkness.  In 1935, Britain built what became known as the motor torpedo boat: a high-speed attack boat adept at swift attacks, especially on submarines.  In 1938, PT boats modeled after the British type entered service in the U.S. Navy.  They played an important role in combat around the Philippine Islands in World War II, but most were removed from the Navy's active list after the war due to their short cruising range and inability to operate in rough seas.  About 25 PT boats, modified for speed (by removing the torpedoes) were active in the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1968 but fell out of action and were eventually phased out as other ships, such as destroyers, diversified their arsenals and capabilities.

[END]

[UNIT_FUSION_TANK_HISTORICAL]
The fusion tank was the answer to many of the prayers of generals and military strategists across the world.  Hover infantry were quickly becoming the dominant force on the battlefield, with their ability to negotiate any terrain, strike swiftly and then scatter.  Conventional artillery and tanks were the only long-range, armored land assault craft available.  Squadrons of hover infantry, employing hand-held anti-tank munitions, literally ran circles around the slow-moving, bulky tanks, wiped out entire armies.  Employing much of the same technology that powered the hover infantry's notorious anti-gravity capabilities, scientists developed a larger-scale anti-gravity levitation and propulsion system.  Unlike the hover infantry's land-based system, the fusion tank's anti-grav system enabled it to travel over shallow water, which increased the fusion tank's operating range and functional capabilities.  

The fusion tank could penetrate heavily armored and fortified targets with its high-powered pulse laser cannon, and track multiple small targets with its smaller magnetic pulse guns.  It rendered conventional tanks nearly obsolete and brought an armored compliment to the hover infantry's swift strike capabilities.

Hoplites were the extremely disciplined, heavily armed foot soldiers that comprised some of the fiercest and most effective fighting units in ancient Greece and Sparta.  Clad in a bronze helmet, breastplate and greaves and armed with a large shield, a sword and a six-foot long thrusting spear, hoplites fought in a close, shoulder-to-shoulder formation called a phalanx.  Before the hoplite's arrival on the battlefield around the 8th century BC, warfare primarily consisted of individual combat.  Advances in bronze working made new and heavier armor and weapons available.  Hoplite phalanxes were typically eight, but sometimes as much as fifty, ranks of soldiers. They would break enemy ranks with their highly compact formation and were considered the best fighters in the Mediterranean.

The development of applied chaos theory opened up new opportunities in the realm of physics.  Scientists were able to develop reliable anti-gravity systems that could act as a propulsion system for small objects.  The military leaped on this discovery and immediately poured considerable financial resources into developing a hover system for individual soldiers.  After several years, the hover infantry unit was born.  Although the hover infantry's anti-grav system does not permit him to fly vertically, it acts as propulsion and levitation system that enables him to traverse any solid terrain.  With the arrival of hover infantry on the battlefields, conventional artillery, tank and infantry units began to find themselves outmaneuvered, outgunned and outclassed.

[UNIT_INFANTRYMAN_HISTORICAL]
The earliest firearms were primitive devices, lacking buttstock or trigger, which had to be held under the arm making them difficult to aim.  The harquebus, which employed both of these things, was developed in the late 15th century.  It's slow rate of fire and inaccuracy did not make up for the fact that soldiers could now fire from their shoulders.  Nevertheless, some 16th century armies, most notably the Spanish tercio, employed harquebusiers with pikemen, who would open fire on approaching enemies and then retreat behind the pikemen as the range of combat got closer.  In 1588, 10,000 English troops were experimentally equipped with firearms, against Spanish forces relying on archers; the success of the English forces played a major role in the rise of firearms as the weapon of choice for infantrymen.  

The musket was the first firearm to employ a flintlock firing mechanism.  Heavier and more powerful than a harquebus, it could be relied on to fire 2 to 3 times a minute at 100 to 150 yard range with minimal misfires.  By the end of the Thirty Years' War, infantrymen, armed with muskets, and pikemen were about equal in numbers for most armies.  Smaller tactical groups of infantrymen facilitated quicker rate of group fire with minimal mutual interference.  Lines dropped from 8 to 10 in the 17th century to 2 to 3 at the end of the 18th century.  Military strategists, most notably Prince Maurice of Nassau, a great Dutch military teacher, developed drill - the preparation for war by prescribed movements and formations - to increase efficiency.  The invention of the bayonet in 1670 gave infantries little reason to keep pikemen, and infantry units employed muskets and bayonet exclusively from then on.

Infectors had two main attacks at their disposal:  a bacterial agent that attacked the respiratory system, rendering victims violently ill, and a highly lethal supervirus that infected humans with a rapidly replicating virus that could kill 90% of infected persons within fourteen days.  Rather than releasing pathogens through time-release capsules or glass vials, they imbued nanites with the agents, which could replicate and spread over a wider area.  Although most nations publicly denounced the use of infectors, virtually every nation employed infectors to some degree in their covert operations.

[UNIT_INTERCEPTOR_HISTORICAL]
Although both the Axis and the Allies employed fighter aircraft equipped with jet engines in World War II, it was too late to significantly impact the outcome of the war.  After 1945, the major world powers endeavored to create a new class of fighter aircraft.  Called interceptors, these craft were designed, like fighters, to seek out and destroy enemy aircraft.  Developments in supersonic jet technology gave rise to a powerful new class of aircraft capable of flying 2 to 3 times as fast as the speed of sound.  The U.S. F-15 Strike Eagle and the Soviet MiG-25 Foxbat were among the most advanced jet fighters of the 1960s, 70s and 80s.  They had fast rates of climb, excellent maneuverability and a formidable arsenal of air-to-air missiles.

The interceptor's extreme speeds and operational altitudes made targeting, striking and destroying other aircraft very complicated, and required an array of advanced electronic, navigational and computational systems.  Single-seated interceptors from the 1980s weighed as much as, and were more complicated to operate than, World War II-era multi-engine bombers.  As interceptor technology advanced, the search and attack functions became increasing automated, almost reducing the pilot's role in combat to monitoring the operation of the equipment.  Modern jet-powered interceptors soon reached a point where their performance capabilities exceeded the human pilots' abilities to control it.

Ships-of-the-line dominated the seas in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries.  This nearly three-decade reign was brought to an end, as wooden warships reinforced with iron armor began to prove themselves in naval combat the world over.  These ships, called ironclads, were first employed by the French in the Crimean War, leading to a naval armor and armaments race between the French and the British.  Both the Union and the Confederacy employed ironclads in the U.S. Civil War.  The Monitor and the Merrimack were undoubtedly the most famous ironclads, fighting the first engagement between ironclad ships in history.

When, early in the Civil War, Union forces abandoned the Norfolk Navy Yard at Portsmouth in Virginia they scuttled the powerful steam frigate Merrimack.  Confederate forces raised it, converted it to an ironclad and renamed it the Virginia.  On March 8th, 1862, the Virginia, commanded by Captain Franklin Buchanan attacked a Union blockading squadron at Hampton Roads sinking or scattering the entire fleet of wooden ships.  The Virginia sustained trivial damage in the conflict.  The next day, however, the Union ironclad Monitor, built by John Ericsson and commanded by Lieutenant John L. Worden, challenged the Virginia, now commanded by Lieutenant Catesby Jones, to a duel.  Although the four-hour conflict resulted in a draw, it revolutionized naval warfare.  Ironclads ruled the seas until the development of the battleship in the 1890s.

[UNIT_KNIGHT_HISTORICAL]
As samurai were the warrior class of feudal Japan, so were knights during the European Middle Ages.  Some knights were vassals holding lands in fief from the lords in whose armies they served.  Entering knighthood was a formalized process.  At around age 7, a young boy destined for a career of war would serve his father as a page.  At age 12, he would join the household of his father's lord for more advanced training in military tactics and the ways of the world.  He was considered a valet until he accompanied his patron on a campaign as écuyer (French, "shieldbearer," root of the modern word esquire) or armiger (French, "weapons bearer").  When his family could afford the cost of knightly equipment and he was considered proficient, he was dubbed a knight.  The dubbing ceremony could be elaborate executed on a royal feast day or a simple touching of the flat blade of a sword on each shoulder in the field of battle.

In much the same was as Japanese samurai adhered to a code of conduct known as Bushido ("the way of the warrior"), knights formulated a code of loyalty, personal integrity and Christian faith that was known as chivalry (from the French word "chevalier," meaning knight).  Knights strived to a Christian ideal of courtesy, deep respect for the Church, loyalty to their superiors and preservation of personal honor.  The Crusades, beginning in the 11th century, were the ultimate expression of the knight's devotion to the Christian Church.  These massive military expeditions, operating under the auspices of the church, spawned the first official orders of knights: Knights dubbed at Christ's tomb became known as knights of the Holy Sepulchre, the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem (Knights of Malta), the Order of the Temple of Solomon (Templars) and the Order of St. Lazarus, which was charged with the special duty of defending leper hospitals.  These orders were international, expressly religious institutions in purpose and form.  Members took vows of celibacy and the organizations themselves operated under hierarchical structures that mimicked the church itself.

From the end of the 11th century to the middle of the 13th, the relationship of knighthood to feudalism changed.  As most knights were enfeoffed landholders, obliged to give 40 days' military service to their lords, the frequency of long-distance expeditions put a strain on the existing ranks.  Lords turned to compulsory service, distraining landholders to join the knighthood.  Even with this new development, knights were reduced to a minority in armies, often acting as officers, as greater numbers of mercenary soldiers were raised to fill the gap.

The traditional knighthood saw a major decline in the 14th and 15th centuries.  Armies of footsoldiers and bowmen consistently defeated knightly armies, and the development of artillery further marginalized the role of the mounted, armor-clad cavalry unit.  The demise of the Crusades and the rise of centralized monarchy eroded the feudal system in which knights thrived.  By the 16th century, knighthood lost its martial purpose and was relegated to nothing more than an honorific status bestowed by sovereigns.

Whereas the Moray Striker derived its navigation and control systems design from genetic research of existing species of sharks, the Kraken was the first operational vehicle to employ an entirely new organic system, based on no living creature.  The Kraken evolved through many prototypes and iterations, finally settling on a genetically tailored vehicle of unprecedented efficiency and power.  Its propulsion system worked like a turbine engine, taking in seawater and ejecting it with considerable force.  It employed large "gills" that extracted oxygen from seawater, providing internal compartments with a renewable oxygen source.  The Kraken was unquestionably the most formidable underwater assault craft of the Genetic Age.

[UNIT_LAWYER_HISTORICAL]
From the period of 200 BC to 600 AD in Greco-Roman civilization, the first class of legal specialists distinct from judges emerged.  Originally, there was prejudice against the idea of legal experts charging fees for their services.  Citizens generally knew the law and applied it in business and litigation with advice from kinsmen and advisors.  Nevertheless, as the law became more complex, men, usually patricians, found a need to study the law in depth, and some were considered experts.  They would often serve as magistrates and, in Rome, priests of the official religion specializing in family law.  Roman legal experts became jurisconsults, acting at a trial as nonpartisan consultants prohibited from receiving fees.  Late in the Roman Empire, the modern lawyer, earning a living by fees paid for legal services, emerged.  It was universally recognized that a subversive system of gifts and under-the-table payment rendered the ban on fees merely a fictitious convention, and the state began to regulate fees paid.  Changes in trial methods spelled the demise of the jurisconsult.  The orator, who previously acted as an untrained partisan, became the advocate and was required to become legally trained.  Jurisconsults found roles as legal professors at state-sponsored schools in Rome and Constantinople.  

In modern times, the lawyer acted as an advocate on behalf of his or her client.  They perform all of the functions that, in Roman times, were divided amongst orators and jurisconsults, including introducing evidence, interrogating witnesses and arguing questions of law and fact.  They were beholden to the needs of their client, the administration of justice and service to the community.  As legal systems around the world varied, so did the roles of lawyers.  In England, lawyers were divided into barristers, who pleaded in the higher courts, and solicitors, who pleaded in the lower courts.  In the United States, attorneys often specialized in areas of the law, such as criminal, personal injury, corporate, probate and divorce, though many maintained general practices.  The reputation of lawyers through modern times varied widely, from the respected, trusted defender of the public and upholder of the rule of law to the ruthless shark of corporate advocacy to the unscrupulous, money-grubbing shyster.  Regardless of reputation, the lawyer was a prominent and integral aspect of the legal system of almost every modern nation.

Conceived by military strategists as the most effective defensive military craft in history, the leviathan was a product of multiple technological developments that occurred over the 21st and 22nd centuries.  It derived powered from a massive internal fusion reactor and moved by way of an anti-gravity hover system.  Its array of enemy tracking systems and arsenal of missiles, bombs, magnetic pulse guns and huge particle beam weapons virtually insured the destruction of targets, be they on land or in the air.  The leviathan was not known for speed or maneuverability, as its sheer size and staggering amounts of armor all but completely thwarted the hover system's ability to move it across terrain.  It gained a reputation for being a perfect defender of cities, and, when stationed in or near a metropolis, the leviathan acted as a nearly impenetrable force, holding ground against legions of fusion tanks and hover infantry as it plucked aircraft out of the sky.  The leviathan often comprised the core of an assault force, acting as a mobile command center, and, when accompanied by more maneuverable armor, infantry and air strike divisions, could secure strategic ground locations with a tenacity never before seen.

The machine gun developed gradually through the 19th century. Early work focused on multi-barrel guns, such as the Gatling gun invented by Richard Gatling in 1862.  However, these guns remained prone to jams due to their reliance on black powder and a gravity-based system of feeding loose bullets into the chamber.  The first true machine guns employed smokeless powder and metallic cartridges to load bullets into the firing chamber more efficiently. In the 1880s, Hiram Maxim built a single barrel gun that repeated fire by using the force of a single shot to discharge the bullet, reload another cartridge and fire again. By feeding it with a fabric belt of bullets, soldiers could fire the Maxim for indefinite periods, never needing to stop and reload.  This development dramatically increased the effectiveness and purpose of infantry.

[UNIT_MARINE_HISTORICAL]
A stalwart and fierce component of modern combat operations, the marine traced its roots back to the 5th century BC.  In their writings, Greek historians Herodotus and Thucydides referred to epibatai, heavily armed sea soldiers in the Greek fleets.  In the 3rd-2nd century BC, the Greek statesman Polybius described a type of Roman soldier, called milites classiarii ("soldiers of the fleet"), who were trained and armed especially for service aboard Roman warships.  In the Middle Ages, standard soldiers often sailed aboard ships to bolster attack and boarding capabilities.  In the 17th century naval wars, the British and Dutch each raised the first distinct and organized corps of modern marines:  the Royal Marine (1664) and the Koninklijke Nederlandse Corps Mariniers (1665), respectively.  Although other countries maintained marine corps, by far the most famous organization of this kind was the United States Marine Corps. 

Founded in 1775 as a separate military service within the U.S. Department of the Navy, the USMC was primarily charged with seizure and defense of advanced bases and with land and air operations related to naval campaigns.  It was also responsible for service aboard certain naval vessels, as well as providing security for shore installations and U.S. diplomatic missions in foreign countries.  Above any other duty, however, the marines specialized in amphibious attacks, such as those undertaken against Japanese-held islands in the Pacific during World War II.  The USMC participated in every war of the United States, often being the first, or among the first, to fight, executed more than 300 landings on foreign shores and served in every major U.S. naval action since 1775.

During World War II, the anti-aircraft and flak cannon were the chief means of defending against air attacks.  Developments in rocketry led to the invention of the surface-to-air missile (SAM), changing air combat forever.  Flying several times the speed of sound, SAMs employed heat-sensitive tracking systems and radar guidance to reach all but the highest flying spy planes.  Even the swiftest planes found SAMs a threat, and planes were soon equipped with chaff and flares to attempt to fool the missile's tracking systems into following alternate objects or heat sources.  SAMs mounted on a vehicle increased operation range.

In the early days of genetics, the primary focus of research was related to unlocking the secrets of cloning.  It was not until much later that scientists began to approach genetics from the perspective of systems analysis.  The noted geneticist Benjamin D. Hagerty was the first to put forth the notion that, by studying the ways in which organic systems, such as the nervous or circulatory system, operated, scientists could gain insight into the nature of systems themselves. Furthermore, studying the way in which systems with the same function varied from species to species, they could also uncover the ways in which systems evolved.  His research garnered him the 2029 Nobel Prize for Genetics and pioneered a completely new field of genetics research.

The first military application of organic systems design culminated in the development of the highly classified underwater scout craft called the Moray Striker.  By analyzing the genetic composition of sharks, geneticists uncovered many of the ways in which sharks operated as hunters.  The Moray Striker's control systems were designed to mimic the complex web of internal and external feedback systems sharks employ to seek food, navigate, fight, scout and avoid threats.  Unlike a shark, the Moray Striker is primarily a reconnaissance craft.  Its superb sensors and wide range of vision make it ideally suited to fast, silent, wide-eyed operation.

[UNIT_NUCLEAR_SUBMARINE_HISTORICAL]
With the commission of the first nuclear powered submarine, the USS Nautilus, in 1954, the nature of naval combat and, particularly, submarine tactics, was forever altered.  Before this, conventional, diesel-electric submarines approached their target on the surface to avoid draining their batteries.  They submerged only when just out of sight of their target and could only approach at very low speeds.  Commanders did this to conserve battery power for after their attack when they would have to use full underwater power to evade counterattack.  Even after this, a full battery charge would last only an hour or two at top underwater speed.  This limitation suited submarines to attacking slower, less defended ships, and meant that they could not engage fast surface warships, such as battleships and aircraft carriers.

Nuclear submarines, by contrast, had a single power supply for both surface and submerged operation.  Powered by the small amount of enriched uranium fuel in its reactor, a nuclear sub could operate fully submerged at full speed indefinitely.  They could operate freely before and after attacking, keeping up with the fastest of surface ships.  In the Falkland Islands conflict of 1982, the British nuclear submarine, HMS Conqueror, demonstrated its revolutionary new power by tracking the swift Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano for more than 48 hours before closing in to sink it.  For the first time, fast warships were vulnerable to submarine attack.

Although major world powers continued to develop both diesel-electric and nuclear vessels concurrently, some abandoned the old technology altogether.  Over the course of the next four decades, nuclear submarines gradually took over in the navies of the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China.

[END]

[UNIT_NUKE_HISTORICAL]
First conceived of and introduced in the mid-20th century, nuclear weapons represented a exponential increase in the power of ranged warfare.  Nuclear weapons derived their great explosive power from the sudden release of energy associated with the splitting, or fission, of the atomic nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium or plutonium.  As part of the Manhattan project, the ultra-secret United States government research project that took place from 1942-1945, the U.S. built and tested the first plutonium atomic bomb, detonating it at a remote location 120 miles south of Albuquerque, New Mexico.  What set nuclear bombs apart from conventional explosive warfare was their explosive force.  

On August 6, 1945, the United States deployed the first nuclear weapon in warfare, dropping a bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.  The single explosion, which had the force of more than 15,000 tons of TNT, completely devastated a four square mile area in the heart of the city of 343,000 people.  66,000 people were killed instantly, while another 67,000 were injured.  Nearly 70 percent of the city's structures were destroyed or damaged.  Three days later, the U.S. dropped a plutonium-type atomic bomb on Nagasaki.  This blast, equal to 21,000 tons of TNT, killed 39,000, injured 25,000 and destroyed or seriously damaged 40 percent of the city's structures.  This attack prompted the surrender of the Japanese forces and the end to the Pacific conflict of World War II.  After the war, the U.S. conducted dozens of test explosions in remote locations in Nevada and at Enewetak atoll in the Pacific Ocean.  Other nations entered the arms race in subsequent years:  the Soviet Union in 1949, Great Britain in 1952, France in 1960, China in 1964, India in 1974 and Pakistan in 1998.

Later iterations of nuclear weapons involved nuclear warheads attached to intercontinental ballistic cruise missiles and the destructive power of nuclear weapons increased with the introduction of fusion, or thermonuclear, bombs.  Whereas fission bombs were measured in kilotons, equal to 1,000 tons of TNT, fusion bombs were measured in megatons, equal to 1,000,000 tons of TNT.  Although nations also developed smaller "tactical" nukes, by the end of the century, many possessed dozens of thermonuclear weapons, each possessing exponentially more destructive power than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

[UNIT_PARATROOPER_HISTORICAL]
During World War II, military forces deployed parachute-equipped infantrymen called paratroopers.  Planes laden with paratroopers could fly deep behind the front lines of conflict and drop directly on enemy emplacements.  They could be used to interrupt supply lines, strike command centers, conduct reconnaissance and, perhaps most important, capture and hold crucial objectives like bridges and key terrain.  Aircraft also enabled infantry to deploy quickly over a larger area.  Paratroopers and airmobile forces became vital to peacekeeping and humanitarian missions beyond the reach of conventional, land-based transportation.  One of the most famous uses of paratroopers occurred on June 6, 1944 in the invasion of Normandy, France.  Allied paratroopers landed behind enemy lines before sunrise and covertly secured strategic areas to make it easier for other soldiers to come ashore from boats.

Although its hover system was not designed for moving over land, the plasma destroyer's long-range bombard capabilities made it ideal as support for amphibious assaults, outclassing the battleship in speed, strength and firepower.  Its considerable arsenal of particle accelerator beams and magnetic pulse guns delivered unprecedented levels of armor-piercing destruction.  Second generation plasma destroyers utilized a long-range enemy tracking system that enabled it to actively defend against any naval threats.

Even though commercial applications of fluid breathing systems were stymied by the unwillingness of regulatory agencies to approve their use, the military found several secret uses for the system.  By far the most advanced was the scout submarine.  Powered by a small nuclear reactor, it was the first manned craft to deploy with no oxygen systems or pressurized hull of any kind.  The two occupants wore deep suits fitted with fluid breathing systems and could explore even the deepest trenches and underwater canyons.  The military secretly contracted scout subs for scientific research missions on occasion but, more often than not, utilized its speed and wide vision range for long-range reconnaissance missions.  It derived its stealth capabilities from a sonar-absorbing, composite exterior surface and a thermally shielded propulsion system that minimized its heat signature.

Since prehistoric times, people often lived a nomadic lifestyle, traveling from place to place, searching for food and shelter.  Some cultures grew weary of this life and opted to settle on fertile ground.  The development of agricultural techniques and tool making made it easier to establish themselves in a single place, grow food, defend their land and harvest resources.  As people formed the first towns and villages and populations grew, small groups would sometimes leave their villages to explore new territory and found new cities.  They sometimes accompanied an army for protection.  Their reasons for striking out on their own were varied: some sought to expand a fledgling nation's borders, some to escape persecution and others desired new or better surroundings.

[END]

[UNIT_SHIP_OF_THE_LINE_HISTORICAL]
As 17th-century naval combat increased in frequency and intensity, particularly in the Anglo-Dutch wars, naval strategists developed the formation of heavy warships call line ahead.  In the line ahead formation, each ship followed in the wake of another, making it easier for each ship in the line to have a clear range for their broadside guns.  Up until the line-ahead tactic, ships of widely varying strength comprised a typical line.  The term ship of the line originated in the 1700s to describe the only suitable ships "to lie in the line of battle."

Ships of the line varied widely in strength and size.  First-raters carried as many as 136 guns but they were considered cumbersome.  The 74-gun third-rater combined speed and maneuverability with decent attack power comprised most of the ships of the line of the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Approximately 175 feet long with two full gun decks, these ships dominated the seas until the development of the battleship in the 1860s.  The British ship of the line Victory, the personal ship of Viscount Nelson launched in 1765 and preserved in dry dock in 1805, is a classic example of the larger of the ships of the line, with three gun decks of 24-pound guns.

[UNIT_SLAVER_HISTORICAL]
The Vikings of Northern Europe often raided other countries in order to capture slaves for sale on the open market.  Throughout the ancient world, conquering empires often enslaved the populations of cities they conquered, sending them to their home countries to work.  The international slave trade proliferated in one form or another for much of the first two millennia AD.  The Ottoman Turks gave the Slavic people of central Europe plots of land in exchange for their sons, who were employed in special regiments of the Ottoman armies.  Those "sclavi" ("sclavus," meaning Slavic, the origin of the modern word slave) who survived could return home to their land and live as free men.  Although this was not a forceful slave raid, it was an exchange born out of duress and intense pressure from Ottoman rulers intent on conquering Europe.

[UNIT_SPY_HISTORICAL]
Throughout history, leaders of nations have always required vast amounts of information in order to implement foreign policy, military strategy, diplomatic negotiation and participation in international organizations.  To sate this thirst, and to protect their safety and interests, governments have always maintained some kind of intelligence capability.  Not surprisingly, all nations have laws against espionage, but most have vast networks of spies operating in other lands.

The Chinese military theorist Sun Tzu espoused the importance of intelligence in his book The Art of War (circa 500 BC).  In it, he gave detailed instructions for espionage systems, including double agents and defectors.  Until the rise of nationalism in the 18th century, and the growth of standing armies and diplomatic establishments, intelligence-gathering operations were indiscriminately designed by rules and military leaders.  

Joseph Fouché, duc d'Otrante, minister of police during the French Revolution and the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, established one of the first political espionage systems.  Fouché retained a network of police agents and professional spies to root out conspiracies by the Jacobins and Bourbon Royalists to seize power.  In the early 19th century, the Austrian statesman Prince von Metternich also employed an organization of political and military spies.  The most notorious intelligence organizations of the 19th century was the dreaded Okhrana (Department for Defense of Public Security and Order) of the Russian tsars, created in 1825 to search for internal opposition to the current regime.

Much of World War I was fought on the basis of poor intelligence, due to the fact that many nations entered the war lacking sufficient espionage resources.  This, along with advances in communications and aviation technology, led to major expansion in intelligence agencies.  The Fascist governments of Europe and the military dictatorship in Japan, with their expansionist foreign policies, established counterespionage agencies, most notably the Gestapo in Nazi Germany.  This led democratic nations to establish counterintelligence operations as well.

[END]

[UNIT_STEALTH_FIGHTER_HISTORICAL]
What set the stealth fighter apart from other strike aircraft was its ability to minimize enemy radar detection.  It used highly advanced composite materials and coatings to absorb radar transmissions and reduce reflections to an enemy's radar receiver.  The use of smoothly rounded shapes instead of sharp edges and points also helped to reduce reflections.  Stealth fighters also carried missiles and other weapons conformally rather than as protruding attachments.  Weapons recessed within the structure of the aircraft further minimizing drag and radar signature.

Stealth technology was not without its costs.  The first stealth fighter, the United States Air Force's F-117, was extremely expensive to build and maintain.  The rounded design demanded highly sophisticated flight control systems, the materials were heavy and reduced its range and payload capacity, existing weapons had to be modified for conformal carriage.  Nevertheless, stealth fighters proved their worth in the Persian Gulf War, crippling Iraqi command and communications centers with surgical guided weapons strikes.

[UNIT_SUBMARINE_HISTORICAL]
The first submarines, developed and tested by both navies of the American Civil War, were extremely primitive "manned torpedoes".  By the turn of the century, however, European and American companies developed a number of improved submarine designs.  Submarines employed a combination of diesel combustion engine and battery power to alternate between surface and underwater modes.  After approaching their target on the surface to avoid draining their batteries, they submerged only when just out of sight of their target, attacking at very low speeds.  Commanders did this to conserve battery power for after their attack when they would have to use full underwater power to evade counterattack.  Even after this, a full battery charge would last only an hour or two at top underwater speed.  This limitation suited submarines to attacking slower, less defended ships, and meant that they could not engage fast surface warships, such as battleships and aircraft carriers.

Samurai were the warrior class during the feudal period of Japanese history from the 12th century until 1871.  They were the military retainers of the feudal landowners known as daimyo (Japanese, "great holders of private land").  The samurai of the Kamakura period (1192-1333) developed themselves as stoic, military experts, in sharp contrast to the more refined samurai of the imperial court.  As the influence of Zen Buddhism began to spread during the Muromachi period (1338-1573), samurai culture produced some of the uniquely Japanese arts, such as the tea ceremony, that existed well into modern times.  The model samurai followed the code of Bushido (Japanese, "The Way of the Warrior"), which maintained bravery, honor and loyalty as more sacred than life itself.  For samurai, ritual suicide by disembowelment (seppuku) was a institutionally and culturally respectable alternative to dishonor, cowardice and defeat.

Until the development of the internal combustion engine in the late 1800s, ships relied on sails and steam engines for power.  Internal combustion engines, although not practical for extremely large ships, were ideal for smaller ships that could not necessarily cope with boiler rooms, which were heavy and required a lot of space.  The "Vandal," built in 1903, was one of the first cargo ships to employ a diesel engine.  The so-called "Liberty" and "Victory" ships were constructed to ferry American soldiers across the Atlantic Ocean to the front lines of the European theatre of World War II.

[UNIT_URBAN_PLANNER_HISTORICAL]
It was the disorder and squalor of 19th century Industrial Revolution-era cities, with their festering, overcrowded slums, which prompted the first modern urban planning and development efforts.  Early city planners imposed laws for the standardization of housing, sewage, sanitation, public health and, perhaps most important, water supply conditions.  Urban planners also introduced parks and playgrounds into congested city neighborhoods, providing places for recreation, as well as visual relief.

20th century urban planning saw the rise of the concept of zoning -- setting limits for building height, neighborhood density and construction activity.  Most cities had grown organically, and as the Industrial Revolution shifted the role and dominance of cities to the fore, they became sprawling, disorganized eyesores, with commercial, industrial and residential areas intertwined and seemingly built on top of each other.

Public transportation was the answer to many issues -- overcrowding, complex street systems, traffic, congested commercial districts, and shortages of housing -- that plagued the sprawling metropolis.  Urban planning was also important to the revitalization of Europe after World War II, where planners shifted their focus to the reconstruction of areas destroyed by war.

By the middle of the 20th century, urban planners experimented with new concepts for towns and cities, and endeavored to create the ideal urban area.  "Planned communities" sprang up, with transportation, recreation, industrial and residential systems in place.  Rather than focusing on fixing problems, planners sought to develop urban areas that would evolve with the changing needs of their citizenry.  Though there have been spectacular failures, many planned cities are a testament to the wisdom of long-term, scalable urban plans that focus on the total living experience.

The development of weapons almost certainly evolved from the first forays into tool making.  Primitive people fashioned stone, wood and bone to assemble crude tools for digging, cutting and hunting.

[UNIT_WAR_WALKER_HISTORICAL]
The development of cybernetics, itself a culmination of discoveries into neural interface technology and gene therapy, encouraged military theorists to rethink the systems by which a human could pilot a vehicle.  Up until the development of the war walker, pilots used manual control devices - joysticks, foot pedals, throttles - to manipulate their vehicle, from supersonic jet to common jeep.  The neural interface-based cybernetic control system was a link between the biological and the mechanical, enabling the conversion of thoughts, registered as neurochemical brain impulses, into computer system commands.  In this way, a pilot could control his vehicle, including propulsion, movement, targeting and weapons systems, through a combination of neural and manual commands.  The feedback systems in war walkers were capable of "remembering" the idiosyncrasies of their human pilots.  Veteran pilots were often highly skilled, in large part due to their walkers' ability to anticipate their movement, targeting and weapon combination preferences.  The war walker soon became one of the most feared military entities in the world, largely due to a superstition that walkers could continue to effectively fight even if their pilots died in the "rig."  Although the notion of the sentient, un-piloted war walker was almost certainly a legend, this blurred line between man and machine only served to increase the ominous mystique of this terrible machine.

[WONDER_THE_AGENCY_HISTORICAL]
Formally created in 1947, the Central Intelligence Agency grew out of the World War II Office of Strategic Services (OSS).  In the U.S., the army, navy and Federal Bureau of Investigation previous handled intelligence and counterintelligence efforts.  Competition, lack of coordination and a duplication of efforts complicated matters and garnered the U.S. criticism from its allies for not having a central intelligence organization.  In June 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the OSS to rein in the disparate strands of intelligence gathering under a single aegis. 

During the Second World War, the OSS collected and analyzed any foreign intelligence related to areas where U.S. military forces operated.  At its height, the OSS numbered nearly 12,000 members.  It gathered evidence from secret agents, it carried out disinformation and counterpropaganda actions and it coordinated special operations behind enemy lines supplying and directing resistance fighters, perpetrating sabotage and demolition.  It was dismantled in October 1945, and, in its place, President Harry S. Truman established, by executive order, the Central Intelligence Group and a National Intelligence Authority in 1946.  These groups gathered key players from the hastily convened OSS and attempted to direct postwar intelligence operations with some semblance of central control.

In 1947, Congress created the National Security Council and, under its direction, the Central Intelligence Agency.  The newly formed CIA was to advise the NSC on intelligence matters bearing on national security, coordinate communication of intelligence within the government and carry out national-security-bearing intelligence operations at the behest of the NSC.

The Via Appia, or Appian Way, was first and most famous ancient Roman road.  Begun in 312 BC by censor Appius Claudius Caecus, it originally ran southeast from Rome 162 miles to Tarentum and was later extended to the Adriatic coast to the huge port at Brundisium.  Roman roads were noted for their solid foundations, straightness and use of concrete made from volcanic ash and lime.  It averaged 20 feet in width and had a slightly cambered surface to facilitate drainage.  The foundation was made of heavy stone blocks cemented together with line mortar.  Expertly fitted polygonal blocks of volcanic concrete formed its surface.

Horace and Statius called the Via Appia "longarum regina viarum," or "queen of long-distance roads."  It was the main highway between Rome and the seaports of southern Italy.  It was so vital to trade, not only within Italy but also with Greece and other eastern Mediterranean nations, that a curator of praetorian rank was charged with administering it.  Portions of the Appian Way remain intact in parts of the Italian countryside.

Along with Plato, Aristotle was one of the two greatest Greek intellectual figures.  More than any other thinker, Aristotle had a profound affect on Western philosophy and science that continued well into modern times.  In 335 BC, he founded a school in a grove sacred to Apollo Lyceius.  Aristotle was in the habit of walking around the grove of the Lyceum while lecturing his students.  This earned the school and its students the label of Peripatetics (from the Greek words peri and patein, meaning "around" and "walk," respectively).  The notes for his lectures, later edited by his successors, comprise the bulk of Aristotle's extant writings.

The matter decompiler improvement helped cities reduced pollution and was a major boon to efforts to preserve the environment.  By enabling people to decompile their solid waste into basic elements, matter decompilers simultaneously reduced pollution and provided raw materials that could be reused.  Unfortunately, many cities could not afford the initial cost of building a matter decompiler.  Pioneering nanotechnology expert David Ray conceived of a nationwide matter decompiler that would supply all cities with the technology.  The Central Matter Decompiler would act as a source of nanites, delivering them to any city with a matter decompiler.  This would dramatically reduce the cost of installation, as cities would be able to build a simpler "recipient" decompiler without having to worry about supplying nanites for the matter processing.

[WONDER_CHICHEN_ITZA_HISTORICAL]
Chichén was a city founded around the 6th century AD, most likely by Maya peoples native to the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.  It consisted of many structures, including the Akabtzib (House of the Dark Writing), the Chichanchob (Red House), the Iglesia (Church), the Casa de las Monjas (Nunnery), and the observatory El Caracol (The Snail).  The Maya abandoned Chichén in 670, but archaeological evidence suggests that, at sometime between the 10th and 12th centuries AD, after the collapse of the Maya cities of the southern lowlands, the Itzá, a tribe of Maya speakers influenced by the Toltec of Central Mexico, resettled Chichén.

The Itzá constructed a few buildings in addition to those that first existed in Chichén, most notably El Castillo (The Great Pyramid).  A magnificent structure, it rose 80 feet above the Main Plaza of the city.  Each of its four sides had 91 stairs and faced a cardinal direction.  When added to the step at the top of the pyramid, the steps totaled 365 - the number of days in a solar year.  It was topped with a carving of a plumed serpent symbolic of Quetzalcóatl (known to the Maya as Kukulcán), one of the major deities of ancient Meso-American culture.  During the equinoxes in the spring and summer, the setting sun cast a shadow giving the appearance of a snake undulating down the stairways.  

In the 19th century, long after the eradication of Maya culture at the hands of Spanish conquerors, Chichén Itzá became a major archaeological site.  Excavations revealed much, including an earlier structure within El Castillo that contained a red jaguar throne studded with jade.

Legends told of the Cult of the Cenote and their practice of human sacrifice to the rain god.  They threw victims into the city's major cenote (a natural well at the northernmost part of the pyramid), along with gold and jade ornaments and other valuables.  In 1904, Edward Herbert Thompson, an American who purchased the Chichén Itzá site, dredged the cenote.  The skeletons and objects of sacrifice confirmed what was considered only a legend.

Challenges to intellectual property and copyright laws filled the courts of the world as government and industry scrambled to cope with a sudden explosion of unregulated commerce, personal freedom and criminal activity.

The concept of a data haven, an ultra-secure, high-speed, collocation hosting facility became increasingly popular.  The notion of hosting data and facilitating transactions outside the jurisdiction of some of the more restrictive nations appealed to many.  In early 2000, the first data haven was created.

Until the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 at the hands of the British, Spain and Portugal monopolized the trading of spices from East India.  On December 31, 1600, a royal charter incorporated the English East India Company as a monopolistic trading body formed for the exploitation of trade with East and Southeast Asia and India.  Although they were successful, the company met with opposition from the Dutch in the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) and the Portuguese.  In 1623, Dutch authorities executed English, Japanese and Portuguese traders in what became known as the Amboina Massacre.  After that, the Dutch excluded company members from the East Indies.  Earlier, in 1612, the company defeated the Portuguese in India and won trading concessions from the Mughal Empire.  They traded cotton, silk, indigo and saltpeter, in addition to spices from South India.  It also extended its operations to the Persian Gulf, Southeast Asia and East Asia.  Eventually, it involved itself in politics, acting on behalf of British imperialistic interests in India from the early 18th century to the mid-19th century, and expanding British influence in China in the 19th century.

The Eden Project was one of the most controversial research projects of the Diamond Age.  It was originally conceived as a theoretical exploration of the potential applications of nano-machines in cleaning up pollution, a branch of science that became known as Gaia Theory.  Ecotopian scientists involved in the multi-national project, however, harbored sinister intentions for the technology.  Researchers discovered the key to enabling prototypical nanites to target pollution lied in designing them to seek a narrow range of chemicals that comprised the bulk of polluting agents.  Since most of these chemicals were synthetic - products of humanity rather than nature - the Ecotopians in the research group seized on the opportunity to develop a nanite that targeted and destroyed any man-made entity within a set area.  This shift in focus turned the "ecology cleanser" from a beneficent tool of world climactic and environmental repair to a device of mass destruction.  The Eco-Ranger raised the specter of the first truly efficient, large-scale annihilator of humanity.  It was particularly attractive to ecology-minded governments because it not only produced no pollution, it actually eliminated pollution within the area of effect.  Although commercial applications of Gaia Theory led to advances in pollution control systems, the destructive uses prevailed, and the arena of nanotechnological combat reached large-scale, terrifying proportions.

The development of the Virtual Democracy form of government signaled a new age in human rights and equality.  Even though democratic governments existed even as early as ancient Greece, they often perpetuated some kind of inequality, be it racial, social or economic.  Modern democracies of the late 20th century were often rife with some of the same injustices present in the most oppressive regimes.  The thrust behind developing a true democracy, free from the easily corruptible institution of representation, was an ardent desire to empower the disenfranchised masses to take control of their government.  Political theorists envisioned a democracy unburdened by the pernicious influence of corporations and special interest groups on the political process.  By eliminating the representatives who often compromised their commitment to the constituencies of citizens in favor of the sums of money dangled before them, a nation of individuals could determine their own futures directly.  The first virtual democracies achieved this aim, powerfully utilizing technology to enabled a true "one-human-one-vote" system.

Long the dreams of human rights activists who struggled to equalize the balance of social, political and economic power in the world's democratic societies, the Egalitarian Act was a fictional document.  They envisioned a bold proclamation reaffirming the equal rights for all citizens, regardless of race, age, gender, and religion.  Even more, they wanted to guarantee access to information, which had become the most important commodity of the modern and genetic ages, for all people.  The virtual democracy had stripped corporations of much of their political power.  As a result, citizens passed sweeping changes to the tax codes and stripped corporations of many of their legal and economic favoritism, which considerably flattened the distribution of wealth.  People who were once poor took advantage of their new economic power to educate themselves, purchase computers and begin participating in the new digital economy.  The Egalitarian Act was the final step in solidifying equal political and social rights for everyone.  On December 5th, 2031, the European Union became the first political entity to enact the Egalitarian Act.  As word spread through the global community, cities around the world teetering on the brink of revolution clamored to join such a progressive nation.  Leaders of oppressive governments found a new challenge from outside of their borders, and many struggled to retain control of their people.

[WONDER_EMANCIPATION_PROCLAMATION_HISTORICAL]
Before the start of the American Civil War, Northern political leaders and abolitionists sought merely to stop the spread of slavery into the western territories that were destined for statehood.  When the Southern states seceded from the Union, marking the beginning of the Civil War, Northerners saw little political purpose in tolerating slavery any further.  The concept of Emancipation suddenly changed from a remote possibility to an eventuality.  Union president Abraham Lincoln declared his intention to preserve the Union however he could - by preserving slavery, by destroying it, or by destroying part and preserving part.  After the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, he issued a proclamation calling on the revolted states to return their allegiance by the end of the year or their slaves would be declared free men.  When no state returned, he issued the declaration on Jan. 1, 1863.

Some historians, and, doubtless some of Lincoln's contemporaries, questioned the validity of the Emancipation Proclamation.  As president, Lincoln lacked the power to issue such a declaration, and, as commander-in-chief of U.S. Armed Forces, he could only issue directions regarding the territory within his lines.  Because the Emancipation Proclamation applied only to territory outside his lines, it was a dubious declaration, lacking any real force.  However, it was significant as a statement of policy to guide the army and as a declaration of freedom that would take effect as the lines advanced.

The Emancipation Proclamation inadvertently lifted the American Civil War to the level of a crusade for human freedom.  It also had many effects on the direction and eventual outcome of the war.  From an international perspective, the Civil War was an unfortunate and calamitous event, as it locked up the world's main source of cotton.  In fact, the Confederate government had expected the English and French governments to intervene in the war.  The transformation of the war into a crusade against slavery precluded any European intervention.  The Emancipation Proclamation also allowed the Union to recruit black soldiers.  Nearly 180,000 black men enlisted during the remainder of the war, significantly bolstering Northern ranks and enabling the Union to crush the rebellion.  

In February 1865, two months before the war ended, Lincoln told portrait painter Francis B. Carpenter that the Emancipation Proclamation was "the central act of my administration, and the greatest event of the nineteenth century."  Lincoln and his compatriots had dealt a deathblow to slavery in the United States, and in December 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified.

Contrary to popular belief, Galileo Galilei, the noted Italian astronomer and physicist, did not invent the telescope.  In 1609, he caught wind of a device in the Netherlands that could show distant things as though they were close by.  Galileo quickly figured out the secret of the invention and made his own three-powered spyglass from lenses purchased at a spectacle maker's shop.  Though others did the same, what distinguished Galileo was that he figured out ways to improve the instrument.  After teaching himself the art of lens grinding, he created increasingly powerful telescopes, and in August of that year he presented an eight-powered instrument to the Venetian Senate.  They awarded him a life tenure and doubled his salary, making him one of the highest paid professors at the University of Padua, where he taught from 1592 until 1610.  

In late 1609, he developed a telescope that magnified up to 20 times.  With it, he observed the heavens and drew the phases of the moon.  He discovered the moon's surface was not smooth, as most thought, but rough and uneven.  In 1610, he discovered several of Jupiter's moons and realized that his telescope showed many more stars than were visible to the naked eye.  He was an adherent of the Copernican heliocentric view of the universe, which stated that the Earth and other planets revolved around the sun.  This earned him enemies in Rome, as Copernicanism was considered heretically inconsistent with Holy Scripture.  A poorly executed Inquisition procedure against other adherents of Copernicanism forced Galileo to recant his assertions.  Despite the official reprimand, his alliances with wealthy and powerful Tuscan and Florentine enabled him to continue working.  His pioneering work in astronomy resonated for centuries, in the sciences of optics, navigation, astronomy and physics.  Galileo's contribution to the human understanding of the universe could not be overstated.

[WONDER_GENOME_PROJECT_HISTORICAL]
On June 26, 2000, scientists involved in two separate projects - the publicly funded Human Genome Project, an international collaboration coordinated by the United States Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Celera Genomics, a private company based in Rockville, Maryland, jointly announced that they had completed a rough draft of the human genome (the complete genetic makeup of human beings).

Researchers approximated the order of 85 percent of the roughly 3.1 billion chemical subunits, called nucleotide base pairs, which constituted the human genome.  However, they had yet to determine the exact count of the estimated 25,000 and 150,000 genes that comprised the human genome.  The US government launched the Human Genome Project in 1990, intending it to last 15 years.  Eventually, research centers in the US, Europe and Japan joined the effort throughout the 90s.  In 1998, Celera began their decoding operation, employing the world's largest group of supercomputers.  The rivalry between the government's Genome Project and the Celera's effort heated up, with allegations of profiteering, flawed strategies and moving too slowly from both sides.  Experts concluded, however, that the sometimes publicly harsh rivalry prompted both sides to work faster.

One of the most incredible wonders of the world, the Great Wall of China stretches for 1,500 miles along the border between Northern China and Mongolia.  It is an amalgamation of many walls built at different points in ancient history; the first unified wall was built in the 3rd century BC by the Ch'in dynasty.  Many of the laborers, conscripted from all over China, died during the project.  The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) later added to it.  Guard stations and watchtowers are placed at regular intervals.  It averages 25 ft in height and is 15 ft to 30 ft thick at the base, sloping to 12 ft at the top.  Although the western part of the wall is just an earth mound, the eastern part is earth and stone faced with brick.  China suffered many invasions from the North, which unfortunately proved the Great Wall to be of little military significance.  The fact that much of it still stands in modern times is a testament to the durability of masonry.

A Latin edition of the Bible, it was printed some time between 1450 and 1456 in Mainz, Germany.  Although German bibliographers claim that it was printed by Gutenberg, the edition may have been finished and perfected by Peter Schöffer, Gutenberg's assistant, and Johann Fust, a wealthy financier who acquired Gutenberg's share of the business in a lawsuit.  Regardless of its exact origins, the Gutenberg Bible was one of the first religious texts mass-produced by machine.

[WONDER_HAGIA_SOPHIA_HISTORICAL]
Hagia Sophia, or Aya Sofia, was one of the world's greatest religious monuments and considered by many to be the supreme example of Byzantine architecture.  In AD 360, 30 or so years after Byzantium became the capital of the Roman Empire, Constantius II erected a basilican church.  This church, which burned in 404, was rebuilt by Theodosius II in 415, and was again destroyed by fire in 532.  The Holy Roman Emperor Justinian rebuilt the church from 532-537, rechristening it the Hagia Sophia, or "Church of Holy Wisdom."  Designed by his architects Anthemius of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus, the new structure was fireproof, but, in 558, severe earthquakes caused the magnificent domed ceiling to collapse.  It was rebuilt in 563 and remained as a Christian monument and holy place for centuries.

The Turks converted Hagia Sophia into a mosque when the conquered Constantinople in 1453.  In later years, they gradually removed or obliterated the Christian symbols, plastering and painting over interior figure mosaics, replacing the altar and pulpit with customary Muslim accoutrements and supplanting the cross on the top of the dome with a crescent.  The four minarets that rise at the corners of the building were added one by one over the years.  In 1935, Hagia Sophia was opened as a museum and dedicated as a non-denominational monument to all faiths.

[WONDER_HOLLYWOOD_HISTORICAL]
When Los Angeles was a small city in the new state of California, a prohibitionist from Kansas named Horace Wilcox created Hollywood as a real-estate subdivision in 1887.  He originally envisioned it as a community based on his rather strict religious principles.  Over the next century, however, it would become an internationally recognized symbol of the film and television industry itself, representing, ironically, some of the worst excesses of modern American culture.

Although the earliest movie production studios existed in New York and Chicago, a determined group of filmmakers transferred their operations to Southern California in the early 1900s, laying the foundation for the development of an entertainment industry of mammoth proportions and success.  Hollywood provided ample sunshine, a mild climate, access to varied terrain and a large labor market.  In 1908, one of the first storytelling movies, The Count of Monte Cristo, was completed in Hollywood after filming began in Chicago.  The first Hollywood studio was founded on Sunset Boulevard in 1911, and soon 20 companies began film production in and around Hollywood.  By 1915, it became the center of the United States motion picture industry as more filmmakers relocated from the East Coast.  Such men as D.W. Griffith, Samuel Goldwyn, Cecil B. de Mille, William Fox Adolph Zukor, Darryl F. Zanuck, Harry Cohn and Louis B. Mayer presided over the great film studios - 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldywn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Columbia, Warner Brothers and others.  Despite robust and thriving film communities all of the world, Hollywood continued to dominate global entertainment well into the 21st century.

In 1973, the United States Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) began a project designed to research technologies for interlinking computer networks of various kinds.  Its objective was to develop protocols to allow computers to communicate transparently across multiple linked networks.  The system of networks that emerged from the "Internetting" project was known as the "Internet."  The protocols system that emerged from this research project was known as the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) protocol suite.

In 1986, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) began development on the NSFNET, which, with its 45 megabit per second facilities, became a major "backbone" of the modern-day Internet.  Eventually, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department of Energy added backbone facilities known as NSINET and ESNET, respectively.  By 1991, the Internet had grown to include over 5,000 networks in almost 40 countries, serving and connecting more than 700,000 host computers used by more than 4,000,000 people.

Although initially, a large percentage of the support for the Internet community came from the U.S. Federal Government, due to its roots as a government-funded research project, private commercial facilities began to take over in the 1980s and, eventually, comprised the bulk of the system.  Several non-governmental organizations, such as the Internet Activities Board, were formed to supervise progress, organize research and development projects and provide a semblance of central direction to what was essentially a cooperative effort on the part of multiple agencies.

In the 1990s, the Internet was expanded beyond government and university research uses to bring millions of individuals together.  Several companies, called Internet Service Providers (ISPs), began to lease access to the Internet for the purposes of electronic mail and access to the World Wide Web.  The gradual explosion of Internet users expanded the potential of the Internet in the realms of communication, business, marketing and entertainment.

In the mid-21st century, nanotechnology had found applications in countless realms, from science and engineering to manufacturing and construction.  One of the most dramatic and far-reaching uses of nano-machines was the invention of the nanite defuser.  Developed by a coalition of nations, the nanite defuser consisted of a timed release of 2 million nanites into the air for seeking out weapons-grade plutonium and uranium.  Guided by gamma rays, the nanites honed in on the highly radioactive substances contained in nuclear missiles around the world and rendered their triggers inoperative.  The nanites then continued to attack the radioactive substances, working to break them down.  The reaction of the world community to the nanite defuser was overwhelmingly positive.  People rejoiced, as the world was once again free from the frightening and destructive power of nuclear weapons.  What had been a dream for centuries was finally a reality.

He grew the mold in a fluid medium and found that the substance it produced killed many of the most common forms of bacteria ailing humans.  In the late 1930s, Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain purified penicillin and, by 1941, an injectable form of the drug became available.

Doctors used penicillin to treat a range of bacterial infections, including those that caused pneumonia, spinal meningitis, syphilis and staphylococcus infections of the throat.  Although some people were violently allergic to it, penicillin became a principal drug in the war against bacterial infection and widespread use throughout the twentieth century contributed to a healthier population wherever it became available.

Built over a period of 2,700 years, from the beginning of the Old Kingdom to the end of the Ptolemaic Period in Egypt, pyramids were the largest, most elaborate funerary edifices in history.  Built as tombs to honor Egyptian royalty, they were often part of a vast architectural complex that included a mortuary temple and a causeway leading down to a pavilion that was probably connected to the Nile by canal.

Although about 80 royal pyramids have been found in Egypt, the most famous of all pyramids are the three 4th-dynasty (c. 2575-c. 2465 BC) pyramids erected on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the Nile River near Al-Jizah (Giza), northern Egypt.  Of the three, the northernmost, oldest and largest was built for the king Khufu (also known by the Greek name Cheops), the second king of the 4th dynasty.  Known as the Great Pyramid, it is probably the single largest structure ever built on the planet.  The length of each side averages 755 feet at its base and it originally stood more than 480 feet high.  Its sides are all correctly oriented to the four cardinal points of the compass.  The other two pyramids, named for Khafre and Menkaure (in Greek, Chephren and Mykerinus, respectively), the fourth and fifth of the eight kings of the 4th dynasty were smaller.

The Great Pyramid's core was made of yellowish limestone blocks, the outer casing and the inner passages were of finer light-colored limestone, and the interior burial chamber was built of huge blocks of granite. Approximately 2.3 million blocks of stone were cut, transported, and assembled to create the 5,750,000-ton masterpiece of technical skill and engineering ability. The internal walls as well as those few outer-casing stones that still remained in place showed finer joints than any other masonry constructed in ancient Egypt.

[WONDER_THE_SOLARIS_PROJECT_HISTORICAL]
The Solaris Project was the most ambitious scientific undertaking in the history of humankind.  Conducted under a veil of secrecy to rival the Manhattan Project of the mid-20th century, it originally set out to prove that the conversion of matter to energy to new matter was possible.  Primary research, which began in 2268, was conducted in one of the first nanite-constructed space stations.  The project took a little over ten years to complete.  Using their knowledge of unified field theory, nanotechnology and smart materials, Solaris Project scientists designed a small probe to launch into the center of the sun.  They believed the secrets to energy to matter conversion lied in the massive fusion reactions of stars.  The probe returned with a staggering array of new data that led researchers to finally reproduce a controlled energy-to-matter conversion in 2274.  The final piece of the puzzle involved designing a system that would perform this entire process, providing a limitless supply of raw materials with which to build and create things.

The Gaia Controller was the application of this technology.  It was comprised of three distinct groups of componentry.  A system of small satellites circled the planet, collecting space debris, solar energy and various other sources of matter.  Once collected the satellites converted the matter to energy, periodically beaming it down to obelisks placed at regular intervals on the surface.  The obelisks were the primary matter collecting entities in the system, sending out vast groups of nanites designed to hunt out polluting agents in the air, water and earth.  They also acted as receptacles for energy collected from satellites.  Obelisks distributed energy to the various Gaia controller cores in cities around the world.  The controller cores enabled operators to oversee the system, distribute and control energy and provide cities with a limitless supply of energy for the creation of new matter.

The complexity of the criminal code, particularly the huge regulations on personal freedom enacted by reactionary moralists, reached a breaking point in the early 21st century.  The criminal justice system, bogged down by the massive burden of prosecuting petty offenses was poised to collapse under the weight of its own labyrinthine depth.
