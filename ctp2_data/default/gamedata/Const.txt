# - Added MAX_MATCH_LIST_CYCLES
# - Added MIN_TURNS_BETWEEN_REVOLT
# - Set back CARAVAN_COEF devision by 10 is now done inside the executable.

# all numbers are integers ranging from 0 to 100

PERCENT_LAND 40 # how much of the world is land
PERCENT_CONTINENT 50 # how much of the world tends toward big continents verses small islands
PERCENT_HOMOGENOUS 55  ## how "clumpy" the land terrain is

# the meridians are normalize on the map at 0 to 100 - 0 is all the way north
# and 100 is all the way south - 50 is the middle  - this works on a map of
# any size

MERIDIANA 5  # north of this is north pole
MERIDIANB 25  # north of this is north mild
MERIDIANC 35  # north of this is north deasert
MERIDIAND 60  # north of this is the equatioral region
MERIDIANE 70  # north of this is south desert
MERIDIANF 95  # north of this is the south mild, south is the south pole

# the humidity controls the ditrabution of forest, jungle, swamp, grass, plains, desert
#	tundra and glacier
# A bump map is randomly generated.  The bumps range from 0 to 100.  High bumps are
#  wet terrain, low vallies are dry terrain. 
# What terrain is used depends on what meridian you are in

# The height value have a gausian distrabution, with middle values being the most
# common.  The HLEVEL values should be adjusted to take into acount the intergral 
# of the gaussian. 

# HLEVELA must be greater the HLEVELB, HLEVELB must be greater then HLEVELC etc

HLEVELA 85  # above this is the wet terrain
HLEVELB 60	# above this is sort of wet terrain
HLEVELC 40	# below is ??? middle terrain
HLEVELD 15  # below this is dry terrain

# The wet/dry slider on the custommap screen uses these values.
# The sum of all the wet values together w/ the swamp wet value will add to 100.
# Similarly for the dry values.  Actually, swamp = 100 - (forest + grass + plains + desert).
