# Modifications from the original Activision code:
#
# - Added MAX_MATCH_LIST_CYCLES
# - Added MIN_TURNS_BETWEEN_REVOLT
# - Set back CARAVAN_COEF devision by 10 is now done inside the executable.
#   - May 7th 2005 Martin Gühmann
# - Made the meridians symetrical. (29-Oct-2007 Martin Gühmann)
# - Increase the city is watchful period to 7 turns. (06-Sep-2008 Martin Gühmann)

# all numbers are integers ranging from 0 to 100

PERCENT_LAND         40  # how much of the world is land
PERCENT_CONTINENT    50  # how much of the world tends toward big continents verses small islands
PERCENT_HOMOGENOUS   55  # how "clumpy" the land terrain is

# the meridians are normalize on the map at 0 to 100 - 0 is all the way north
# and 100 is all the way south - 50 is the middle  - this works on a map of
# any size

MERIDIANA  5  # north of this is north pole
MERIDIANB 25  # north of this is north mild
MERIDIANC 35  # north of this is north desert
MERIDIAND 65  # north of this is the equatioral region
MERIDIANE 75  # north of this is south desert
MERIDIANF 95  # north of this is the south mild, south is the south pole

# The humidity controls the distribution of forest, jungle, swamp, grass, plains, desert
# tundra and glacier.
# A bump map is randomly generated. The bumps range from 0 to 100. High bumps are
# wet terrain, low bumps are dry terrain.
# What terrain is used depends on what meridian you are in.

# The height values have a gausian distribution, with middle values being the most
# common. The HLEVEL values should be adjusted to take into account the integral 
# of the gaussian.

# HLEVELA must be greater the HLEVELB, HLEVELB must be greater then HLEVELC etc

HLEVELA 85  # above this is the wet terrain
HLEVELB 60  # above this is sort of wet terrain
HLEVELC 40  # below is ??? middle terrain
HLEVELD 15  # below this is dry terrain

# The wet/dry slider on the custommap screen uses these values.
# The sum of all the wet values together w/ the swamp wet value will add to 100.
# Similarly for the dry values.  Actually, swamp = 100 - (forest + grass + plains + desert).
