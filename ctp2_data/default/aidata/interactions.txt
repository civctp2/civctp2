
How does diplomacy work?

AI Diplomacy sequence:

Step 1) Create ranked list of motivations (fears and desires).
Step 2) Select top motivation.
Step 3) Select highest priority New Proposal triggered by top motivation.
Step 4) Send highest priority New Proposal triggered by motivation, if any.
     4a) Receiver select highest priority Proposal Response triggered by New Proposal
	 4b) Receiver sends highest priority Proposal Response (Counter, Accept or Reject).
	 4c) Sender selects highest priority Counter Response triggered by Proposal Response.
	 4d) Sender sends highest priority Counter Response (Threat, Accept or Reject).
Step 5) Select next highest motivation, if any; go to Step 3.

Do not show proposals:

Events that effect trust:

	Having a pact or alliance gives 2 units of trust every turn.

	No violating one of the following for 20 turns gives 10 units of trust.
		PROPOSAL_REQUEST_WITHDRAW_TROOPS
		PROPOSAL_REQUEST_STOP_PIRACY
		PROPOSAL_REQUEST_REDUCE_POLLUTION
		PROPOSAL_REQUEST_STOP_RESEARCH

Events that effect regard:

1.  LOST_BATTLE: (REGARD_EVENT_MILITARY_POWER)

	If lost a military unit when at war, then no regard cost.  

2.  ATTACKED_CIVILIANS: (REGARD_EVENT_MILITARY_SAFETY)

	If lost a non-military unit, during war or not, then regard cost
	'WartimeAttackRegardCost' applied to attacker.

3.  PEACETIME_BORDER_INCURSION: (REGARD_EVENT_MILITARY_SAFETY)

	If first unit to incur, not at war, and not in an alliance with
	intruder, apply 'IncursionRegardCost' toward regard for them.
	Allies likewise record 'IncursionRegardCost' for intruder.  If a
	peace treaty exists, then that peace treaty is canceled and regard
	and trust costs are applied.

4.  BORDER_INCURSION_PULLOUT: (REGARD_EVENT_MILITARY_SAFETY)

	If a unit that is not an allie removes their last army from its
    borders, then the lesser of the -1 * 'IncursionRegardCost' or
    enough regard to create REGARD_NEUTRAL regard in the
    MILITARY_SAFETY category is applied.  Same applies for allies of
    border owner.

5.  INVADER_MOVEMENT: (REGARD_EVENT_MILITARY_SAFETY)

	If anyone moves behind the borders of an AI, then
	'InvaderMovementCost' is applied each time the unit moves.

6.  UNPROVOKED_ATTACK: (REGARD_EVENT_MILITARY_SAFETY)

	If lost a unit when not at war, then regard cost
	'PreemptiveAttackRegardCost' applied to attacker.

7.  VIOLATED_PEACE_TREATY: (REGARD_EVENT_DIPLOMACY)

	If lost a unit to an attacker that we had a ceasefire, peace or
	alliance with, then apply violation cost for treaty and trust cost
	for treaty as defined in diplomacy.txt .

8.  VIOLATED_STOP_PIRACY: (REGARD_EVENT_DIPLOMACY)

	If army pirates the route of someone has a stop piracy agreement with, then
	apply violation cost and trust cost from diplomacy.txt .  Clears any stop piracy
	agreements between players.  Also cancel any alliance between the players.

9.  ENEMY_CONVERTED_CITY: (REGARD_EVENT_DIPLOMACY)

	When an army converts a city, then city owner applies 'ConvertCityRegardCost' and
	breaks any alliance between the players.

10. ENEMY_SHARES_CONTINENT: (REGARD_EVENT_MILITARY_POWER)

	Any nations that share a continent, that have contact, are not at
	war and do not have an alliance apply 'ShareContinentRegardCost'
	unless the regard is below the hotwar regard level.  

11. DECLARE_WAR

	For AI that have a diplomatic state inwhich the proposal element for 
	PROPOSAL_TREATY_DECLARE_WAR is not zero, then consider going to war.

    If nation has hotwar regard for foreigner, not at war with anyone
	else, not at war with the foreigner for last 5 rounds, and has a
	personality that desires to be at war with the foreigner, then war
	is declared.

12. CAPTURE_CITY

	Everytime a city is captured, there is a regard cost assessed.  Even if no defenders are in the city, war should be declared if a city is captured and any cease fires, peace treaties or alliances are canceled and any regard loss for violating them is assessed.
