# Remarks
#
# - This file contains all the feat message strings.
#   It contains nothing else.
# - The order of the strings has been synchronized in the English, French, 
#   German, Italian and Spanish version. This has not been done for the 
#   Japanese version, since that file is missing from the CTP2 source 
#   code project.
# - If you add new strings make sure that you add them at the same location
#   in every language version you have.
# - For easy comparison between the languages make sure that the number
#   of lines in each language file version is the same and that also the
#   comments are at the same place.
# - Keep also the indentation the same.
# - You may add comments after the last line of strings that are specific to 
#   one language only.
